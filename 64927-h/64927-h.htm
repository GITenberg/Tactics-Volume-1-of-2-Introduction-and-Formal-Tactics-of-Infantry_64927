instance of Major John F. Morrison, General Staff, who
desired to make use of it in the course in tactics in the
Army Service Schools.</p>

<p>It is an epitome of the interpretation and application
of tactical principles in the various armies, discussed in
the light of the tactical views and methods prevailing in
Germany, and amplified by numerous examples from military
history.</p>

<p>The professional value of this book to all officers of
our Regular Army and Militia who are endeavoring to
gain a working knowledge of tactics, is so obvious that
any comment would be superfluous.</p>

<p>The first volume of “Tactics,” which appeared in its
first edition in 1896, and for which the preparatory work
reached back more than a decade, now appears in its
fourth edition in a completely changed form. The lessons
gained in war and improvements in weapons have corrected
many earlier views. While the Boer war confused
the views on infantry combat and brought forth more
lessons in a negative than in a positive form, the Russo-Japanese
war has had a great educating influence, in that
it corroborated the soundness of the lessons gained in the
Franco-German war, but also in that it amplified those
lessons commensurate with the improvements in weapons.
The fundamental principles upon which success depends
have remained the same.</p>

<p>For a long time I hesitated to comply with my publisher’s
wishes for a new edition. It would not have been
difficult to publish long ago a new edition, based upon the
many lessons of war communicated to me by members of
foreign armies soon after the Russo-Japanese war. But,
after an extended period of theoretical work, I was more
inclined to avail myself once more of the opportunity of
gaining practical experience by service with troops. Pure
theoretical reflection is only too apt to depart from the requirements
of practice and to overlook the friction appearing
everywhere. The battalion commander, more than
any one else, is called upon to act as the tactical instructor
of his officers and knows best where the shoe pinches.
Moreover, the proximity of the maneuver ground to my
present station gave me an opportunity of observing the<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevi">[vi]</span>
field training of a large number of battalions and regiments
of infantry and artillery, and to compare notes with
brother officers of the other arms. In addition, several
trips abroad and, incidental thereto, visits to battlefields,
furnished valuable suggestions. I postponed issuing the
new edition until the publication of the new Russian and
Japanese Drill Regulations, which, with our own excellent
regulations, best illustrate the lessons learned from
the war in the Far East. For this fourth edition I was
further able to draw upon the new French (1904), Italian
(1905), Belgian (1906), U. S. (1904), British (1905), and
Swiss (1908) Drill Regulations. This enumeration alone
justifies the statement, “completely revised,” appearing on
the title page.</p>

<p>I have earnestly endeavored to make use of foreign
experiences in detail. The words of Lieutenant-General
Sir Ian Hamilton of the British Army, to whose writings
I owe a great deal, deserve special attention in studying
the drill regulations of foreign armies: “It is a blessing
that the greater and prouder an army, the more immovably
it is steeped in conservatism, so that as a whole it is
finally incapable of assimilating the lessons gained by
other armies. Military attachés may discover the most
important points in the training and employment of foreign
armies and urgently recommend their imitation, but
their comrades will pay no more attention to them than
did Napoleon III. to Stoffel’s reports on the Prussian army
before the outbreak of the Franco-German war.”</p>

<p>The treatment of the subject matter has remained the
same throughout; it represents, as in the first edition, the
principle that tactical lessons must be deduced from human
nature, from the effect of weapons, and from experience
in war, proper regard being had for national characteristics
and historical transmission. <i>Tactics is psychology.</i>
My statements in regard to fire effect are based, as before,
upon the works of His Excellency, Lieutenant-General<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevii">[vii]</span>
Rohne. The publications of Historical Section I of the
Great General Staff and the splendid works of the late
Major Kunz, furnish the basis for examples cited from
military history. An almost too copious literature is
already available on the Russo-Japanese war. The monographs
(<cite>Einzelschriften</cite>) of the Great General Staff, and of
Streffleur, especially “<i>Urteile und Beobachtungen von Mitkämpfern</i>,”
published by the latter, afford a rich field for
research.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to cite examples from military history
in support of any tactical procedure, but such examples
require a very careful sifting before they can be recommended
as worthy models for our action in front of the
enemy.</p>

<p>The Austrians deduced the necessity of the most brutal
shock action from the experience gained by them in their
combats in Upper Italy in 1859, and the British were not
very far removed from completely denying the feasibility of
making an attack soon after the Boer war; but the desire to
avoid losses was forced into the background by the necessity
of annihilating the enemy. In the Far East the Russians
finally had to learn again the same bitter lessons as
at Plevna.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with this fourth edition, there appears
in Athens a translation in Modern Greek from the pen of
Captain Strategos of the Greek General Staff, well known
to many German officers from his War Academy days.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the fourth edition may receive the
same kind reception at home and abroad that was given
its three predecessors. For all communications, suggestions
or corrections, directed either to me or to my publisher,
I will be sincerely grateful.</p>

<h4>1. WAR.</h4>

<p>Clausewitz, in his work <cite>On War</cite>, defines war as “a
continuation of state policy by other means; an act of violence
committed to force the opponent to comply with our will.”
The civil code is incapable of furnishing full satisfaction to
individuals in cases of outraged honor, and is obliged, under
certain circumstances, to allow the injured party to obtain
such satisfaction by immediate chastisement of the offender
or by challenging him to a duel. In like manner there is no
law which could afford nations complete satisfaction for
affronts to their honor; and it is obvious that it would be as
impossible to abolish war in the world, in the family of
nations, as it would be to abolish dueling among the subjects
of a state. The total abolition of dueling would produce the
same results on the life of the individual that the cessation
of wars would produce on the development of the national
life of every state and on the intercourse of nations with one
another. “Eternal peace,” wrote Moltke on December 11th,
1880, to Professor Bluntschli, “is a dream, and not even a
beautiful one; for war is a part of God’s system in ruling
the universe. In war, man develops the highest virtues;
courage and unselfishness, devotion to duty and self-sacrifice
even to death. Without war the world would stagnate in
materialism.” Treitschke ventured a similar opinion in
1869.<a id="FNanchor1" href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “Every nation, especially a refined and cultured one,
is apt to lapse into effeminacy and selfishness during a protracted
period of peace. The unlimited comfort enjoyed by
society causes not only the downfall of the state but destroys
at the same time all those ideals which make life worth living.
Narrow provincialism or selfish and worldly activity, looking
only toward the gratification of all desires of the individual,
undermines the foundations of a higher moral philosophy and
the belief in ideals. Fools arrive at the vain conclusion that
the life object of the individual is acquisition and enjoyment;
that the purpose of the state is simply to facilitate the business
affairs of its citizens; that man is appointed by an all-wise
providence to buy cheaply and to sell at a profit; they
conclude that war, which interferes with man’s activities,
is the greatest evil, and that modern armies are only a sorry
remnant of mediaeval barbarism. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It proves a
positive blessing to such a generation if fate commits it to
a great and righteous war, and the more it has become attached
to the comfortable habits of mere social existence,
the more violent the reaction which rouses it to warlike deeds
in the service of the state. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*” “The moment the
state calls, ‘My life, my existence is at stake,’ there is aroused
in a free people that highest of all virtues, the courage of
self-sacrifice, which can never exist in time of peace nor be
developed to such an extent by peaceful pursuits. Millions
are united in the one thought&mdash;the fatherland; they are animated
by that common sentiment of devotion unto death&mdash;patriotism&mdash;which,
once experienced, is never again forgotten,
and which ennobles and hallows the life of a whole generation.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*” The greatness of war lies in those very
phases which an effeminate civilization deems impious. “A
great nation must be powerful,” exclaimed Scherr, in 1870.<a id="FNanchor2" href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
“That is not only its duty, but its nature. If opposition is encountered,
a nation is not only permitted to force a way for
its righteous cause and resort to war, but it is its duty to do
so. War always has been, and, so long as men and nations
exist on the earth, it always will be, the <i>ultima ratio</i>.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span></p>

<p>Since war is the <i>ultima ratio</i> of state policy, and as a
sovereign state must insist on absolute independence in determining
its affairs and its course of action, it follows that
the verdict of a court of arbitration, on the larger and more
serious questions, can have a decisive influence on the action
of the contending parties only if the arbitrator possesses the
power to enforce his decision, and is embued with a determination
to use that power. Thus the Pope was able to arbitrate
the question of right between Germany and Spain as to
the possession of the Caroline Islands, but a like verdict
could never decide the question of might between Germany
and France as to the possession of Alsace-Lorraine.<a id="FNanchor3" href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote3" href="#FNanchor3" class="label">&#8199;&#8199;[3]</a> The constitution of the old German Confederation provided for a settlement
of disputes arising among its members; this verdict was to be enforced by
summary proceedings when necessary. The war of 1866 proved that the paragraphs
of the constitution mentioned, of necessity had to fail the moment the
vital interests of two powerful states came into conflict. See <span class="smcap">von Lettow-Vorbeck</span>,
<cite>Geschichte des Krieges von 1866</cite>, I, p. 115.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The utopian plans for a universal international court of
arbitration are chimerical and conjured up by idealists unacquainted
with the harsh facts of reality, if their ideas are
not, indeed&mdash;as are many proposals for disarmament&mdash;calculated
to serve as a cloak for ambitious plans.</p>

<p>If diplomatic means do not suffice to adjust a dispute,
then the question of right between two states at once becomes
a question of might. But the existence of a spirit of fair
play is taken into account nevertheless, for each party to the
controversy will seek to have the justice of its cause recognized.
The moral support engendered by fighting for a just
cause is so great that no state is willing to dispense with it.<a id="FNanchor4" href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
This circumstance, coupled with the growing power of public
opinion and with the influence of representative government,
has contributed to reduce the number of wars. Wars between
cabinets, like those in the days of Louis XIV., are no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
possible. As a result of the universal liability to service,
the whole nation takes part in a war; every class of society
suffers and has its pursuits interfered with; everything
presses to an early decision, to a prompt crushing of the
opponent.</p>

<p>This is attained by defeating the enemy’s forces, by
occupying the hostile country and seizing the enemy’s sources
of supply, so that he will be convinced of the futility of
further resistance. (Campaigns of 1859, 1866, and 1870-71).
Only in the rarest cases will it be necessary to continue the
war until the power of resistance of the hostile state is completely
destroyed. (American Civil War). The extent to
which the enemy’s power of resistance may have to be crippled
or broken, in order to compel peace, depends upon his
tenacity. Political considerations will also have to be taken
into account in answering this question. From the military
point of view, however, the purpose of every war will always
be the complete overthrow of the enemy.</p>

<h4>2. STRATEGY AND TACTICS.</h4>

<p>Precise definitions of strategy and tactics, clearly fixing
the scope of each, have been vainly sought in the past.
That efforts in this direction have led to no results is only
natural, as tactics and strategy are complementary subjects
that often encroach upon each other, while grand tactics is
frequently identical with strategy.</p>

<p>Von Bülow, the author of <cite>The Spirit of Modern Warfare</cite>
(1798)<a id="FNanchor5" href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, calls those movements strategical which are
made outside the enemy’s sphere of information. Von Willisen
considers strategy the science of communications, tactics
the science of fighting. Von Clausewitz calls strategy the
science of the use of battles for the purpose of the war<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
(Jomini: “<i>l’art de diriger les armées sur les théatres d’opérations</i>”)<a id="FNanchor6" href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>,
tactics the science of the use of military forces in
battle (Jomini: “<i>l’art de diriger les troupes sur les champs de
bataille</i>”).<a id="FNanchor7" href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><a id="FNanchor8" href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
General von Horsetzki (1892) defines strategy
as the study of the conditions necessary for success in war.
Archduke Charles calls strategy the “science of war” and
tactics the “art of war”. Frederick the Great and Napoleon
always employed the term “<i>l’art de guerre</i>” instead of the
term “<i>strategy</i>”. None of these definitions are comprehensive
enough, because they do not cover marches, outposts, the
supply service, and enterprises in minor tactics. Professor
Delbrück’s definition is much more appropriate: “Strategy
is the science of utilizing military resources for the attainment
of the object of the war, tactics the art of leading troops
into and in battle.” Thiers, the French historian, instead
of seeking to define strategy and tactics, contents himself with
explaining the problems of each: “<i>Le stratège doit concevoir
le plan de campagne, embrasser d’un seul coup d’oeil tout le
théatre présumé de la guerre, tracer lignes d’opérations et
diriger les masses sur les points décisifs. Le tacticien a pour
mission de régler l’ordre de leurs marches, de les disposer en
bataille aux différents points, indiqués par le stratège, d’engager
l’action, de la soutenir et de manoeuvrer pour atteindre
le but proposé.</i>”<a id="FNanchor9" href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Fieldmarshal Moltke calls strategy “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
application of common sense to the conduct of war.”<a id="FNanchor10" href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> For
practical purposes it is sufficient to define strategy as the
<i>science of the conduct of war</i>, tactics as the <i>science of troop-leading</i>.
Strategy brings about the decision on the theater
of war, while the duty of carrying it out, in the manner
desired by the commander-in-chief, devolves upon tactics.
Thus the strategical idea culminates on the battlefield. The
concentric advance of the Prussian armies into Bohemia in
1866 naturally led to a complete envelopment of the Austrians
on the field of Königgrätz. The German attack in the battle
on the Hallue, Dec. 23rd, 1870, was based on the strategical
requirement of driving the French from their line of retreat
leading to Arras and Bapaume, by enveloping their right
flank. The attempts made by the 15th Infantry Division,
which was holding the enemy in front, to envelop the left
wing of the French, interfered with the execution of the
correct strategical plan. Thus, in following up a success,
in itself quite unimportant (the capture of Bussy), the leading
basic principle was forgotten. The same thing happened
here that Moltke censured in his official report on the war
of 1866, wherein he stated: “The higher commanders have
not been able to make their influence felt down to the subordinate
grades. Frequently, as soon as the divisions and
brigades have come in contact with the enemy, all control
over them has entirely ceased.”</p>

<p>Archduke Charles considered the subordination of tactics
to strategy a law. “Tactics should execute the conceptions
of strategy; where the two come in conflict, where strategical
considerations are opposed to tactical interests, the strategical
considerations should, as a rule, take precedence. Tactics
must occupy a subordinate place and attempt to neutralize
existing disadvantages by skillful dispositions.” Clausewitz
not unjustly censures Archduke Charles for placing advantages
of terrain in the first rank, and for failing to attach the
proper importance to the annihilation of the hostile forces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
Should the demands of strategy conflict with those of tactics
on the battlefield, the latter must unquestionably take precedence,
since the general’s foremost thought must be the annihilation
of the hostile forces. Tactical considerations should
likewise govern in the selection of the direction of attack in
a battle, strategical reasons for striking in this or that direction
becoming effective only after the attainment of tactical
success. It is true that strategy, by directing the armies and
their concentration on the battlefield, provides tactics with
the tools for fighting and assures the probability of victory;
but, on the other hand, the commander-in-chief appropriates
the fruits of each victory and makes them the basis for
further plans. “The demands of strategy are silent in the
presence of tactical victory; they adapt themselves to the
newly created situation.” Fieldmarshal <span class="smcap">Moltke</span>.<a id="FNanchor11" href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote11" href="#FNanchor11" class="label">&#8199;[11]</a> The view that the direction of attack should be governed by the possibility
of easy execution in minor warfare only, is held by General v. Scherff, who
says: “General v. Moltke was not influenced by the question ‘will the attack
here or there be tactically easier or more difficult?’ Only the question, ‘will it
there be strategically advantageous or not’ was able to determine his course with
reference to measures on the battlefield.”</p>

<h4>3. THE METHOD OF INSTRUCTION.</h4>

<p>While Archduke Charles considers mathematical axioms
the basis of the higher art of war, military history is for us
the principal source from which to gather knowledge.<a id="FNanchor12" href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote12" href="#FNanchor12" class="label">&#8199;[12]</a>
See lecture by Prince <span class="smcap">Hohenlohe</span>: <cite>Kriegserfahrung und Kriegsgeschichte</cite>,
Neisse, 1879.</p>

<p>“Let my son often read and meditate upon history; it is the only true philosophy.
Let him often read and meditate upon the wars of the great captains;
it is the only means of learning the art of war.” <span class="smcap">Napoleon I.</span>, on April 17th,
1821.</p>

<p>“Past events are useful to feed the imagination and furnish the memory,
provided their study is the repetition of ideas that judgment should pass upon.”
<span class="smcap">Frederick the Great.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In military history we have a guide by which, if we lack
personal experience in war, we can test the results of our
reflections and of our experience on the drillground. Military
history moreover enables us to appreciate those controlling<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
factors which, in map problems, do not appear at all,
and which, in exercises on the terrain, appear only in a restricted
measure. One must learn the conduct of war from
the experience of others; one’s own experience is costly and
is almost invariably gained too late. That experience in war,
of itself, is not sufficient (aside from the fact that it is gained
too late in a given case) is illustrated by the defeat of the
Austrians in 1866, of the French in 1870-71, and of the
British in South Africa. “<i>Les Autrichiens</i>,” says Colonel
Foch,<a id="FNanchor13" href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> “<i>ont fait la guerre sans la comprendre, les Prussiens
l’ont compris sans la faire, mais ils l’ont étudiée.</i>” “Military
history is neither a compilation of clever theories nor a book
designed for whiling away idle moments. It is, on the contrary,
a careful teacher, who, if we are attentive, allows us to
view and grasp matters which we have never before been
in a position to see, but which, nevertheless, are liable to
confront us in the same, a similar, or a changed form, and
demand unpremeditated, instant and decisive action, entailing
heavy responsibilities. Military history, it is true, offers us,
in the first instance, only events and their outline, conditions
and phenomena, but it also presents, what the cleverest theory
is unable to furnish, a graphic illustration of the disturbing
elements in war, an illustration of the influences, doubts,
embarrassments, unforeseen accidents, surprises and delays.
It describes the course pursued by commanders and by practical
military common sense in surmounting these difficulties.
It prepares in advance the mental balance necessary at the
moment of action; it should prepare also for the unexpected.
It affords a substitute for lack of military experience, for the
accumulation of which the life of the individual, prior to the
moment of action, has been too short.”<a id="FNanchor14" href="#Footnote14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The pedantic enumeration
of a few examples in support of a stated opinion cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
suffice. It should not be difficult to find examples from
military history in support of any opinion; frequently even
an incorrect tactical contention can be vindicated by such examples.
For in war the action taken is as often wrong as
correct; the scales are turned by factors which in most cases
appear indistinctly or not at all. The experiences of military
history must, therefore, only be used with caution if tactical
lessons are to be drawn from them. “A mere allusion to
historical events,” says Clausewitz in his chapter on examples,
“has the further disadvantage that some readers are either
not sufficiently acquainted with these events, or remember
them too imperfectly to enter into the author’s ideas, so that
such students are compelled to accept his statements blindly
or to remain unconvinced. It is, of course, very difficult to
describe historical events as they ought to be described if
they are to be used as proofs, for authors usually lack the
means, as well as the time and space, necessary for such descriptions.
We maintain, however, that in establishing a new
or a doubtful view, a single event, thoroughly described, is
more instructive than a mere allusion to ten. The principal
evil resulting from a superficial reference to historical events
does not lie in the fact that the author cites them incorrectly
in support of his theory, but in the fact that he has never
become thoroughly acquainted with those events. In consequence
of such a superficial, haphazard treatment of history,
a hundred erroneous views and theoretical projects are created,
which would never have appeared if the author had
been compelled to deduce, from a careful analysis of the connected
facts in the case, what he publishes and wishes to support
by historical proofs. If we have convinced ourselves
of the above outlined difficulties attending the employment of
historical examples, and appreciate the necessity for thoroughness
in their treatment, we will come to the conclusion that
the more recent military history is the most natural source
from which to select examples, inasmuch as recent history<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
alone is sufficiently known and analyzed.”<a id="FNanchor15" href="#Footnote15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The events from
military history mentioned in this work are cited simply as
proofs of certain phenomena; the proper analysis of these
proofs must be left to the student.</p>

<p>The applicatory method<a id="FNanchor16" href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is used frequently by preference
as the system of instruction, but its creator, General von
Verdy du Vernois, considers it merely a complement of the
deductive method, on which it is predicated and based. “The
weakness of the whole applicatory system of instruction lies
in the fact that a textbook based upon it, although written
by a master hand, can portray only isolated examples, and
that these, studied again and again, soon lose their value in
the same manner as a maneuver terrain that has become too
well known. For, although we ordinarily find principles
represented in a connected form, this method of instruction
can only convey them in a fragmentary manner in connection
with the details of the events described.”<a id="FNanchor17" href="#Footnote17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The success of
the applicatory method depends largely upon the individuality
of the instructor, and owes its charm to the personal intercourse
between teacher and pupil. Only an expert, who possesses
a thorough professional knowledge, who is master of
his subject, and who has the faculty of presenting it skillfully,
will be able to produce imaginary scenes which faithfully
represent reality and are free from objectionable features.
By constant practice with specific cases, under the
most diverse situations, the nature of war may in this way
be taught and initiative developed as well as facility acquired
in issuing appropriate, clear, and concise orders. One danger
of using nothing but the applicatory method must be noted.
The instructor, as representative of a definite theory, finds it
comparatively easy to select the conditions governing a specific
case in such a way that the theory which he represents necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
appears to be the correct one. This is especially true
when the director of an applicatory problem determines the
action of the opposing side. The two methods (the applicatory,
or inductive, and the deductive) must be so supplemented
that the lesson in tactics clearly illustrates the purpose
and object of a tactical operation and allows of the
attainment of a thorough knowledge of the means necessary
to gain that object.<a id="FNanchor18" href="#Footnote18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> “He who is able to understand the
situation, has a definite purpose in view, and knows the means
with which to carry out that purpose, will, by a simple mental
operation, arrive in each particular case at an appropriate decision,
and will be able, furthermore, to carry out that decision,
provided he does not lose his head. If a clear comprehension
of the purpose in view and of the means for
carrying out that purpose lie within the sphere of theory, the
estimate of the situation and the decision are governed by the
circumstances of the particular case. Should the training in
this direction lie outside the sphere of theory, it will logically
belong to the domain of the applicatory method of instruction.
The two methods must, therefore, supplement each
other.</p>

<p>If the decision is to culminate in action, strength of
character is required, providing the determination to execute,
in spite of unavoidable difficulties, what has been recognized
as proper, and also the professional ability necessary to carry
out the determination to its logical conclusion. All that theory
can do toward forming this character is to emphasize its importance
and to refer students to military history. The applicatory
method, however, can develop strength of character
by compelling the student to form decisions under pressure
of a specified time limit (in solving problems) or by subjecting
him to the influences of certain situations such as would<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
be encountered in war (maneuvers). The means available
in tactical instruction in time of peace, for the development
of strength of character, are, however, very limited when
compared with the great demands made by the abnormal conditions
of war, so out of all proportion to those of peace.
This should be thoroughly understood, lest we overestimate

<p>After theory has fulfilled its mission of clearly indicating

means by which it may be attained, and applicatory practice

history. From this fountain of knowledge both “theory”
and “applicatory method” must draw their material; to this
source they must again and again refer in order to guard
against erroneous ideas of their own creation, which are

<p>Viewed as the science of the leading and employment of
troops, tactics may be divided into two parts:</p>

<p>1. <b>Formal tactics</b>, or that contained in drill regulations.
This portion of tactics furnishes the formations used
by troops when assembled, on the march, and in action, and
contains the regulations governing the conduct in battle of
troops acting alone without regard to the coöperation of
the other arms, and without reference to the terrain.</p>

<p>2. <b>Applied tactics</b><a id="FNanchor20" href="#Footnote20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> deals with the combined action of
the several arms on the march, in camp, and in action,
taking into account influences of the terrain, seasons, and the
time of day in field warfare. Fortress warfare should, strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
speaking, be included under this heading; that is to say, the
employment of tactical principles<a id="FNanchor21" href="#Footnote21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> pertaining to the mobile
arms, in conjunction with foot-artillery and technical troops
on a prepared battlefield. The principles are the same in field
and fortress warfare; the only difference between them lies
in the employment of the means necessitated by the preparation
of a field of battle in time of peace. Military history
shows that a clear distinction between field and fortress warfare
is impossible. (Sebastopol, Düppel, Plevna, and Port
Arthur).</p>

<h4>4. DRILL REGULATIONS.</h4>

<p>Drill regulations are the accumulation of the tactical
views and lessons of a certain period. They illustrate the
tactical condition which becomes perceptible at the moment
of a certain development of the fighting tools as represented
by man and weapons. Man, in his peculiarities, in his weaknesses,
is the constant. He constitutes the psychological element,
inseparable from the science of combat, and as such is
the definitely given magnitude; the effect of weapons, however,
appears always as the variable factor. New weapons,
therefore, necessitate new tactics.</p>

<p>It will be observed also “that changes of tactics have not
only taken place <i>after</i> changes in weapons, which necessarily
is the case, but that the interval between such changes has
been unduly long. This doubtless arises from the fact that
an improvement of weapons is due to the energy of one or
two men, while changes in tactics have to overcome the
inertia of a conservative class; but it is a great evil. It can
be remedied only by a candid recognition of each change.”<a id="FNanchor22" href="#Footnote22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
The history of the tactics of the 19th Century furnishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
more than one instructive example of the magnitude of such
“obstinate conservatism.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is a marked peculiarity of manuals of instruction,
that, no matter with what far-sightedness such regulations
may have been originally compiled, they become antiquated
in a comparatively short time. Napoleon estimated this
period at ten years. Frequent changes are certainly not desirable,
if tactical development is not to be interfered with
and if inconveniences are to be avoided in organizing our
mobile army from our peace organizations, Reservists, and
Landwehr. On the other hand, the regulations must keep
abreast of requirements if the conditions to which they owe
their existence have changed. In his “Military Fantasies”
the Prince de Ligne wrote in 1783: “An article which
should be added to all drill regulations, and which, I know
not why, is omitted, is: ‘Act sometimes contrary to the regulations.’
It is just as necessary to teach that one must act
contrary to the regulations, as to teach the disorder of troops
as it will occur in action.”</p>

<p>It is always dangerous to be behind the times, as troops
thereby relinquish a superiority previously possessed over
others, which knowledge they must later purchase, with
streams of blood, in the face of hostile bullets. Of what
avail, to the Austrians in 1866, to the Russians in 1877,
were all their valiant assaults, made with tactical formations
that had outlived their usefulness in the face of newer
weapons, although made with the firm determination to conquer?</p>

<p>The self-sacrificing spirit and firmly rooted discipline
of the troops found an insurmountable obstacle in the rapid
fire of unshaken infantry. The war experiences of our
regiments show that bullets quickly write a new tactics,
demolish superannuated formations and create new ones. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
at what a sacrifice!<a id="FNanchor23" href="#Footnote23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> In the Franco-German war, superior
leadership and a better artillery permitted us to pay this
price for the lesson. But how an army fares when it lacks
these auxiliaries is shown by the British experiences in South
Africa. The initial failure of accustomed tactical formations
causes a dread of the frontal attack and finally leads some
tacticians to deny entirely even the feasibility of such an attack.
In peace training, therefore, set forms are of less importance;
stress should be laid on developing the faculty of
adaptation to changing conditions of combat and terrain.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote23" href="#FNanchor23" class="label">&#8199;[23]</a> It is frequently customary on the outbreak of a war to issue “Instructions
for campaign,” in order to prepare troops, trained according to superannuated regulations,
for action on a strange theater of war. It is desirable to disseminate
the first experiences gained in action to all parts of the army. We failed to do
this in 1870, and all organizations were therefore compelled to gain this experience
for themselves. Even as late as the 18th of August, 1870, the Füsilier
Battalion of the 85th Infantry advanced in double column formed on the center,
although the campaign in Bohemia had already demonstrated that this formation
was out of date. See <span class="smcap">Moltke</span>, <cite>Feldzug von 1859</cite>, p. 65.</p>

<p>Further development and justification of the principles
of the drill regulations, and the modification of those principles
under certain assumptions, are reserved to the science
of tactics. Drill regulations should not be textbooks of tactics,
but, on the other hand, a textbook of tactics should deal
with formations only in so far as that is necessary to ensure
a clear comprehension of the fundamental principles.</p>

<p>“Regulations and the science of combat are in a certain
sense very different subjects. The regulations are law, authority&mdash;no
doubt can be entertained on this point; but that
also invests them with the character of something fixed, at
least for a certain space of time. They cannot be kept up
to date so as to meet quickly enough the rapidly changing
and ever growing demands of modern combat: that would
indeed be an unfair requirement, impossible of realization.
Here must enter the science of combat, which should be independent
in every direction, which should know no fixed
rules, and which should point to no other authority than that
of truth and reality. It is not the province of the science of<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
combat, like that of regulations, to retain that which is in
keeping with prevailing views and forms; it must take into
consideration the fleeting theory and practice, ever developing
and changing anew.”<a id="FNanchor24" href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>A positive system of tactics will therefore be based upon
one’s own drill regulations, from the standpoint of which it
will investigate and compare the principles of the service
manuals of the different powers, and finally develop the
science still further by the aid of experience gained from
military history and the knowledge of the effect of weapons.
While these are the ever changing but nevertheless measurable
factors of tactical reflection, a third, perhaps the
most important factor, must be added, viz., that the leader
must reckon with the action of men frequently exposed to the
influence of great exertions and great mental agitation. <i>A
doctrine of tactics which does not properly appreciate the
psychological element stagnates in lifeless pedantry.</i></p>

<h4>1. THE IMPORTANCE AND EMPLOYMENT OF
INFANTRY.</h4>

<p>In all modern armies infantry is, in virtue of its numbers
and importance, the principal arm. Since the introduction
of firearms, infantry has gradually increased in importance
and numbers as compared with the other arms.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In the Thirty Years’ war, the proportion of cavalry to infantry was as
1:1, or 1:2, and frequently the cavalry even predominated. In the Swedish
army one gun per 1,000 men was considered sufficient. During the era
of linear tactics in the 18th Century the proportion between the two
principal arms had become as 1:2 and 1:3; in the Napoleonic wars as
1:6 and 1:8. The number of guns was increased to 4 per 1,000 men. In
the course of a campaign the ratio changes to the disadvantage of infantry.
At the outbreak of the war of 1870-71, the relative proportions of the
three arms in the German IInd Army were as follows: cavalry to infantry
as 1:8; and 3.4 guns per 1,000 men. The proportion between the
two principal arms in the IIIrd Army Corps of the German army, at the
outbreak of the Franco-German war, was as 1:18.8; on the first day of
the battle of Le Mans it was as 1:16.6; at the opening of the campaign
there were 4.6 guns per 1,000 men, at the close of the campaign 5.8 guns
per 1,000 men. This was still more marked in the Ist Bavarian Army
Corps, which, on October 31st, had 5.8 guns and on December 9th even
11.1 guns per 1,000 men. At present Germany has approximately 6, and
France 3.63 guns per 1,000 infantry.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The manner in which infantry fights imprints its distinguishing
mark on the tactics of an entire period; thus, according
to the combat formations of infantry, we may speak
of a period of “linear,” “column,” and “extended order” tactics.
Infantry can be equipped more cheaply and trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
more quickly than the other arms. In July, 1870, the French
army consisted of 116 infantry regiments and 21 rifle battalions,
but 38 rifle battalions were raised in addition to a
large number of regiments of <i>gardes mobiles</i> and volunteers.</p>

<p>Infantry is as well adapted for combat with firearms as
for combat with the bayonet, for attack as for defense, for
action in close as in extended order. It can fight on any
terrain which is at all passable, and is more independent of
weather and seasons than the other arms; it surpasses the
other arms in endurance, a man, on account of his will
power, bearing privations and exertions better than a horse.
On the other hand, the losses suffered by foot troops in action
and through exertions on the march are greater than
those of the mounted arms.<a id="FNanchor25" href="#Footnote25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The rate of march of infantry is so slow that in reconnaissance
it can only by great exertions attain results which a
small force of cavalry would obtain without appreciable effort.
Infantry acting alone therefore unquestionably requires
the assignment of mounted men for reconnaissance and messenger
duty. As regards reconnaissance, infantry is like a
man walking in the dark, who can guard against collisions
only by stretching out his hand and feeling his way.</p>

<p>The lack of artillery support will also make itself felt
when infantry encounters fire at ranges at which it is defenseless,
owing to the limited range of its rifle. Infantry
cannot dispense with artillery when it has to attack localities
or fortified points in villages.</p>

<p>The infantry of the 19th Century fell heir to the distinction
made in the 18th Century between heavy infantry
(infantry of the line) and light infantry, the latter being employed
only in skirmish duty and in the service of security.
In the 18th Century the expensive method of recruiting by<span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span>
means of bounties made it necessary to avoid using troops
in indecisive, costly fire actions, and to preserve the expensive
personnel for decisive shock action <i>en masse</i>. Skirmishing
was left to volunteer battalions, to Jägers, and to Füsiliers.
In Prussia the number of Füsilier battalions was increased
to 24 at the close of the 18th Century. Napoleon I. was,
on principle, opposed to the theory of light infantry. He demanded
but one species of infantry, “a good infantry.” In
spite of this, however, he became the originator of an <i>élite</i>
infantry, when, for reasons of discipline, he created one
<i>voltigeur</i> and one <i>grenadier</i> company in each battalion.
While battalion tactics predominated, <i>i.e.</i>, until the close of
the campaign of 1866, this arrangement was imitated in
most states. At the time of the Russo-Turkish war, Russia
still had in each battalion a fifth company, one of sharpshooters,
which, though not recruited at the expense of the
other companies, was formed of better material and received
special training in extended order fighting. Following the
example set by Austria, Prussia, in 1812, designated the
third rank principally for extended order fighting, by forming
it into a third platoon in each company when in action.
This was called the sharpshooters’ platoon and was composed
of the best shots and the most skillful men of the company.
As late as the campaign of 1866 there were instances of the
employment of the combined sharpshooter platoons of a battalion.
Here we have an actual <i>élite</i> force assembled in provisional
organizations, not at the expense of the rest of the
troops, however.</p>

<p>The system of column tactics, which required that every
company should be equally skilled in extended order fighting,
led to the abolishment of <i>élite</i> companies. The Prussian
<i>élite</i>, consisting of the platoons formed from the third rank,
although not always compatible with the employment of company
columns, was not abolished until 1876. The experience
of the Franco-German war had shown that, in view of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
extensive use of extended order formations, an independent
employment of single platoons was out of the question, as in
the course of an action the firing line absorbs not only entire
companies, but regiments and brigades; and, moreover, that
every platoon, as a unit for fire action, must possess those
elements which will carry it forward even after its leader
has fallen.</p>

<p>Napoleon formed his Guards by selecting men and officers
from the entire army for use as a battle reserve. By
granting them privileges and by loading them with distinctions,
he attached them to his person, and they assumed the
character of household troops of a dynasty.</p>

<p>The Prussian and Russian Guards are differently constituted.
They are not, strictly speaking, <i>corps d’élite</i>, for
they are not selected from the ranks of the army. While it
is true that the Prussian Guard receives a better class of recruits
and the composition of its corps of officers and the selection
of its commanders guarantee conspicuous results, its
principal superiority lies in the fact that it serves constantly
under the eye of the emperor.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of accurate breechloading weapons,
and their use by all infantry, Jägers and riflemen have
no tactical excuse for existing, except where they are specially
trained in mountain warfare (<i>Chasseurs alpins</i>,
<i>Alpini</i>)<a id="FNanchor26" href="#Footnote26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, or
where they are intended to serve as a support for cavalry divisions.
(France). While Jäger-battalions are at present employed
like the rest of the infantry, they are retained by us
as such because of tradition and for reasons of organization
(they are recruited from forestry personnel), and an attempt
is made in their tactical employment to turn their excellent
marksmanship and skill in the use of ground to good
account whenever possible. Jägers will be employed in defense,
preferably for holding important points, and for combat<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
and service of security on difficult terrain. Military experience
has shown, however, that in actual war it was seldom
possible to take advantage of these special characteristics;
that in most cases the Jägers were used as other infantry,
and that infantry units fighting shoulder to shoulder
with Jägers accomplished as good results as the latter. Since
the war of 1866 the demand for special employment of
Jägers has ceased. The brief course of the campaign of
1866, in which our infantry acted mostly on the offensive,
gave the Jägers an opportunity for profitable employment
only where, contrary to accepted notions, they fought side
by side with the rest of the infantry.<a id="FNanchor27" href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

an action a reverse threw us on the defensive (1st Jäger-Battalion at Trautenau,
and also at Rosberitz). The superior commanders, in attempting to assign them
a special role, frequently employed them unprofitably in taking up rallying positions
(3rd, 7th, and 8th Jäger-Battalions on July 3rd), sometimes even to escort
baggage (3rd and 4th Companies of the Jägers of the Guard at Soor; and the
1st and 4th Companies of the 5th Jäger-Battalion at Schweinschädel); or they
distributed them along the whole front for the purpose of conducting extended
order fighting. When they were thus distributed among infantry organizations
their efforts merged with those of the infantry.</p>

flanks of the Guard Infantry Division, and the 2nd Jäger-Battalion was on this
day distributed by companies along the front of the entire division.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Mountain warfare presents such difficult problems to
troops, requires a sum total of endurance, energy and intelligence,
physical qualifications and special familiarity, that
neither every recruit nor every unit of the army will quite
fulfill all its demands, although the experience of Suworov,
during his campaign in the Alps, apparently contradicts this
statement. Many disadvantages can be neutralized by peace
training and discipline, of course, but training alone will not
suffice. For overcoming the difficulties peculiar to mountain
warfare, a suitable equipment permitting free movement, and
at the same time ensuring the comfort of the men while at<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
rest, is necessary. The lack of such mountain equipment is
keenly felt even during short exercises lasting only a few
days. Even Switzerland plans at present the formation of
three mountain brigades. Austria already has special mountain
brigades assembled for mountain warfare in its Kaiser-Jäger,
Rural Riflemen, and also in the troops of Bosnia and
Dalmatia. The Italian <i>Alpini</i> (consisting of 22 battalions
in time of peace, to which militia companies are attached
on mobilization, and which have in addition a reserve of 22
territorial companies) form a selected corps which is doubtless
capable of accomplishing excellent results. The Italians
propose to attach machine guns to these units. It is worthy
of note that these troops carry explosives. In France the
troops garrisoned in the Alpine districts are divided into thirteen
groups, each consisting of one battalion, one mountain
battery, one engineer company, and machine guns.</p>

<p>As modern fire effect makes it impossible for mounted
officers to direct the firing line, it was natural to use the
more improved means of communication, the telephone and
telegraph, in addition to the visual signals employed by the
navy.</p>

<p>The improvements made in weapons have had a further
influence on the transformation of the infantry. Even a
small force of infantry can with its magazine fire inflict annihilating
losses in a very short time on closed bodies offering
favorable targets, especially when this fire is delivered from
a flanking position. This requires, on the one hand, that
greater attention be paid during combat to local reconnaissance,
which can be but imperfectly made by mounted officers
with the troops, and, on the other hand, it necessitates the
employment of smaller independent detachments for our own
security and for harassing the enemy. Intimately connected
herewith is the introduction of machine guns, possessing
great mobility, which enables them to take advantage of
rapidly passing moments for pouring a heavy fire on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
enemy and also for reinforcing the independent cavalry in
advance of the army.</p>

<p>In England it was decided to form mounted infantry
charged with the additional duty of augmenting the fire of
a cavalry division, and of furnishing the commander-in-chief
with a reserve possessing the requisite mobility to permit its
being thrown to any threatened point of the long battle lines
of today. But of what importance is the fire of a single
battalion in the large armies of the present day? The principal
drawback to the employment of mounted infantry is,
however, that, when mounted, it is defenseless against cavalry,
and that, while in motion, it really needs a supporting force.
In the Boer war the mounted infantry grew finally to a strength
of 50,000 men. As it was not confronted by cavalry, it
made good during the execution of wide turning movements,
which Lord Roberts employed with success for the purpose
of striking the flank of the Boers, who always rapidly extended
their lines. In spite of these good services, it could
not be denied that mounted infantry had many faults. The
men knew nothing of the care of their mounts, as is evidenced
by the large percentage of horses which became unserviceable.
As mounted infantry units were improvised
bodies, they lacked the requisite training in marching and
tactical employment. After the war had lasted for some
time, the mounted infantrymen, however, had completely forgotten
their infantry character and deported themselves like
cavalrymen, even if only as poor ones. Thus, we find toward
the close of the campaign numerous attacks made by mounted
infantry on the British side, as, strange to relate, also on
that of the Boers.</p>

<p>In this experiment of creating mounted infantry, all
those drawbacks which had been learned for centuries were
exemplified. As an improvisation, mounted infantry disturbs
the cohesion of organizations; if permanently organized, it
must become cavalry, just as the dragoons became cavalry:<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
for mounted infantry is neither flesh, fish, nor fowl and cannot
endure.</p>

<p>The British Drill Regulations (1904) for mounted infantry
lay down the following principles for its employment:</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In the practical employment of mounted infantry, sight must not be
lost of the fact that this arm is drilled and trained as infantry. On account
of its greater mobility, it should be able to cover greater distances,
and, in addition, be capable of executing wider turning movements than
infantry. As a rule, mounted infantry is to be used in the following cases:</p>

<p>(a) It is to perform the service of security in the immediate front
of infantry divisions in conjunction with cavalry and the horse batteries
assigned to the latter, in addition to augmenting the fire of the cavalry.
It is further to occupy, as expeditiously as possible, tactically important
positions. It is to find positions from which it can bring fire, preferably
flanking fire, to bear on the flanks of hostile cavalry before the actual combat
begins. It is to improve every success gained and constitute a formed
nucleus in case of a retreat. Moreover, mounted infantry should enable
the cavalry divisions, far in advance of the army, to devote themselves
exclusively to the strategical reconnaissance with which they are charged.</p>

<p>(b) In addition, the mounted infantry is to constitute a light mobile
reserve which the commander-in-chief can despatch at a moment’s notice
from one wing to the other for the purpose of lending assistance, or for
influencing the action at particular points and for which other troops are
not available on account of the extraordinary extension of modern lines
of battle.</p>

<p>(c) Finally, mounted infantry is to fill the role of a mobile column
in minor warfare or in expeditions in colonial wars, and in performing
this duty assume the functions of the absent cavalry in the service of
reconnaissance and patrolling.</p>

<p>The following is the organization and strength of mounted infantry
organizations:</p>

<p>In war every infantry battalion is to furnish one company of mounted
infantry, consisting of 5 officers, 138 men, and 144 horses; and every
brigade (4 battalions) one battalion of four companies. To each battalion
of mounted infantry is assigned: one machine gun platoon, consisting of
two guns and two ammunition carts (2 officers, 40 men, and 54 horses).
Hence the aggregate strength of a battalion of mounted infantry is: 28
officers, 630 men, and 676 horses.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The creation of mounted infantry is only proper where
climatic conditions make long marches by European troops
impossible, or in cases where the arrival of a few soldiers at
distant points will exert a potent influence on the actions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
an opponent. As shown by our experience in Southwest
Africa, the proper field for mounted infantry is colonial
(guerrilla) warfare, especially when it is important to prevent
the outbreak of threatened disorders and to let the country
return quickly to a state of peace upon completion of the
principal actions. On European theaters of war, space is
lacking for the employment of mounted infantry, and, moreover,
there are not enough horses. In organizing mounted
infantry, an auxiliary arm, which can be of use only occasionally,
has been created at the expense of infantry and cavalry.
The infantry itself should endeavor to meet all demands for
local reconnaissance and communication, without weakening
the cavalry for its principal duties, and without, in so doing,
crippling its own fighting efficiency.</p>

<p>For the purpose of reconnaissance, patrols or scouting
detachments are used. Their usefulness in difficult country
and in enterprises against the enemy’s flank or rear cannot
be denied. In minor operations, by advancing on side roads,
they can hamper the enemy’s reconnaissance, secure the flanks
of their own force, ascertain the probable extent of the
prospective battlefield, and, finally, having gained a firm foothold,
they can become very annoying to the hostile artillery.
In a large battle the necessary elbow room for such employment
is lacking. To form special organizations of picked
men, as is done in Russia, is always of doubtful value. An
organization cannot dispense with its best men in action; it
needs them as group leaders and as substitutes for disabled
non-commissioned officers. While everything goes without
a hitch, the withdrawal of good men from an organization
is of little importance; the drawbacks to this procedure become
apparent, however, when heavy losses deplete the ranks,
when the line begins to waver, when, in the absence of officers,
only the example of courageous men prevents the weak-kneed
from running away. Our regulations properly appreciate
the importance of psychological impressions during critical
combat situations; they state: “The man who feels his<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
courage and coolness going, in the excitement of battle,
should look toward his officers. Should they have fallen, he
will find plenty of non-commissioned officers and brave privates
whose example will revive his courage.” (Par. 268
German I. D. R.). If it becomes necessary to despatch a
stronger infantry force on a mission of minor importance,
it will usually be better to detail an entire company than to
improvise a detachment whose leader would know his men
only imperfectly. From the standpoint of training, scouting
detachments have an entirely different value. They give
young infantry officers, who are tied to a command, an opportunity
to develop self-confidence, decision, and tactical
judgment; to cope with hardships and difficulties on their own
responsibility. In this manner characteristics may be developed
in the young officers which will be of benefit to them
in a large battle. It is obvious that scouts should be assigned
bicycles to give them the mobility which infantry
lacks.</p>

<p>If the roads are good, cyclists<a id="FNanchor28" href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> will frequently be able to
take the place of cavalry in messenger service. In this case
they remain with their organizations and perform the same
duties as the other soldiers. The employment of cyclists
is in accord with the principle that in war every resource the
country offers for warfare should be utilized. The advantage
of the use of cyclists for messenger service and their value to
the command generally is obvious; they are, in addition,
adapted for reconnaissance work and for reinforcing the divisional
cavalry. Cyclists, however, do not lend themselves
to the formation of separate organizations for battle purposes
(each division has 110 cyclists), for a large number of picked
men would thereby be withdrawn from the ranks of the
troops engaged. An improvised cyclist detachment would, in
addition, accomplish very little, as it would lack the thorough
peace training requisite for cohesive action as an organization.<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
If the opinion is entertained that cyclist detachments
could furnish substantial aid to the cavalry<a id="FNanchor29" href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in advance of
the army, that they could be employed profitably in the supply
districts and in minor operations, and, finally, if the available
material in the country is to be utilized, nothing remains but
to proceed to the creation of cyclist companies in time of
peace. The material necessary for repairs and for ammunition
supply can only be entrusted to permanent organizations.
The advantages of cyclists are their great mobility,<a id="FNanchor30" href="#Footnote30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> their
prompt readiness for firing, and, above all else, the noiselessness
of their movements. Their weakness lies in their dependence
upon a complicated machine, in the comparatively large
road space taken up by them on the march (100 cyclists in
column of twos take up about 250 to 300 m. road space), and
in their dependence on the terrain. The last mentioned drawback
can be remedied apparently only by the adoption of a
folding wheel, but, since the cyclist’s equipment cannot be secured
on the machine, it is better in difficult country to push
the wheels or to leave them behind under guard when
necessary.</p>

covering a retreat, in outpost duty, and during the execution of technical work.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote30" href="#FNanchor30" class="label">&#8199;[30]</a> According to the
<cite>Italian Regulations of 1904</cite>, the rate of march of cyclists is
as follows: slow rate 8 km., maneuvering rate, 10-12 km., road speed, 12-17 km.,
accelerated rate of march, up to 20 km. per hour. Cyclists can ride up to 80
km., without long rests. For riding 90-100 km., from 5 to 6 hours are required.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In Italy, France, and England more has been done towards the formation
of cyclist detachments than elsewhere. In Italy each <i>Bersaglieri</i>
Regiment has one company of cyclists, which is to be employed in supporting
a cavalry brigade. Cyclists have accomplished a good deal in
surmounting difficulties of the terrain. In England the development of
cyclist bodies is left mostly to the volunteers and their exercises have
demonstrated that such units are capable of expanding in a brief space
of time.</p>

<p>In France the cyclist movement is led by Major Gerard, who rendered
valuable service during a short maneuver of the cavalry division (1905).
Opinions are as yet divided as to the advisability of forming cyclist<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
battalions. Both Major Gerard and General Langlois are advocates of
their employment. General Langlois desires to oppose the brutal German
battle tactics with rapid maneuvers of mobile reserves which he would
form of cyclist battalions, artillery, and cavalry.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>According to the Cyclist Regulations dated September
10th, 1904, the cyclist company is to be looked upon as
infantry, which is capable of moving at great speed, but is
tied to the network of roads. The cyclist companies are
principally intended for defensive action, holding an important
point until the arrival of infantry. They are also to
serve as support for cavalry and artillery, but are not adapted
for reconnaissance work. Since it is difficult for them to
secure their flanks on the march, they are to be used mainly
in combination with other arms.</p>

<p>In winter campaigns, when wheel and horse cannot be
used, recourse is had to the Canadian snowshoe (a web shoe)
or to the Norwegian snowshoe or ski (skee). In France,
Italy, Austria,<a id="FNanchor31" href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland marching
on snowshoes is assiduously practiced, while in Germany the
troops have so far done little in this line. The ski is, however,
coming more and more into vogue among the rural
population of the German mountains.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote31" href="#FNanchor31" class="label">&#8199;[31]</a> One of the most remarkable snowshoe marches ever recorded is without
doubt that made by the ski detachment of the 4th Regiment of Tirolese Kaiser-Jägers
(Austria) stationed in Salzburg. In June, 1905, this detachment, consisting
of 4 officers, 15 men and 4 guides, all with field equipment, marched
around the base of the “Grosz Glockner,” via Mittersil, Felber-Tauern (elev.
2,500 m.), Windisch-Matrey, Lienz, Dolsack, Hochtor (elev. 2,570 m.), into the
Fuscher valley, despite violent cyclonic snow storms, a journey which, even in
mid-summer, can only be undertaken by experienced tourists. In several of
these detachments experiments were made with white covers for uniform and
equipment, which enabled individual men and patrols to approach unseen to
within 200 to 300 m. of an opponent.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Deep snow is an effective obstacle for troops not
equipped with snowshoes. This is not entirely due to the
fact that the march is retarded, but to the unusual difficulties
attending the service of security. Covering bodies are stalled.
Besides, the difficulties of maintaining communication with
neighboring detachments are increased when valleys or abrupt<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
declivities intervene between the forces. The only
remedy in such cases is to employ the snowshoe, upon
which one can move rapidly without regard to roads,
and up or down hill without difficulty. Patrols can be despatched
to adequate distances from the marching body on skis
alone. Ski-runners can perform the same duty which cavalry
performs on the plain; for instance, they can occupy
points in advance which are of importance to us, dispute
crossings with the enemy, and hold him at bay. Ski detachments
alone are able to reconnoiter the condition of roads
and test the carrying power of snow in advance of a command,
and they alone can furnish the connecting links in an
extended outpost position, because they alone are able to
move off the roads. During halts they furnish guards;
in action they easily turn the enemy’s flanks, reconnoiter his
weak points as well as the position of his reserves; and after
the fight they maintain contact with him as patrols. They
can hasten forward in advance of a command and prepare
cantonments and bivouacs, and attend to the cooking.</p>

<p>The great depth of a detachment of ski-runners is a disadvantage.
Each ski-runner takes up 2.20 m., and in addition
a distance of 1 m. must be left between men. Besides,
as the men are not all equally skilled in using skis,
the road space taken up by a detachment of runners is increased
considerably. This necessitates the employment of
small detachments not exceeding 100 men. The proper
sphere of ski-runners is patrol duty. In winter campaigns
ski-runners are a necessary substitute for cavalry. In Scandinavia
reconnaissance detachments are composed of ski-runners
and cavalry, the horses pulling the runners. This
permits a very rapid movement over snow-covered ground
and may also be employed where the use of the much slower
sled is impracticable owing to the nature of the terrain.
Much practice is undoubtedly necessary to acquire proficiency<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
in this sport<a id="FNanchor32" href="#Footnote32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>, for it surely cannot be easy to preserve an
upright position on skis behind a galloping horse, while at
the same time overcoming all the difficulties of the ground.
When troopers cannot continue to perform reconnaissance
work, they are replaced by snowshoe or ski-runners. The
snowshoe performances in France, since the establishment
by War Department order of a training school in Briançon,
are worthy of note. According to the experiences gained at
that institution, a period of four weeks is ample for training
men for extended mountain marches. On January 18th,
1904, a body of men on snowshoes covered a distance of
80 km., including a climb of 1,700 m., in 20 hours (4 hours’
rest included).</p>

<h4>2. THE TACTICAL UNIT.</h4>

<p>By the term tactical unit is meant the smallest element
of a body of troops capable of sustaining an action independently,
of performing a simple combat task, and the elements
of which (man and horse) are personally known to
the leader. Moreover, the tactical unit should be small
enough to allow of its being controlled by the voice of a
single leader. This requirement limits the battle front of
the tactical unit to about 100 m., which corresponds approximately
to the front of a troop<a id="FNanchor33" href="#Footnote33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (<i>Eskadron</i>) in line, or to
that of a battery of six pieces. The frontage of the tactical
unit of cavalry might with advantage be decreased, while
that of artillery, on account of its stability in action, might
be extended, were it not for the fact that the increase in the
quantity of matériel and in the number of horses involved
in such extension would make the supervision of the unit too<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
difficult for a single person. In nearly all large armies the
strength of a troop (<i>Eskadron</i>) of cavalry and of a field
battery is approximately 150 horses.<a id="FNanchor34" href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This corresponds approximately
to what the farmer of northern Germany considers
suitable to keep together in one establishment. If the
estate is larger, requiring more than 150 men and horses,
subsidiary farms<a id="FNanchor35" href="#Footnote35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> are established.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote33" href="#FNanchor33" class="label">&#8199;[33]</a> <i>Eskadron</i>
has been rendered by “troop” in this work. The German <i>Eskadron</i>
consists of 4-5 officers, 138-144 men, and 135-139 horses. It is the
smallest administrative unit of the German cavalry and is divided into four
Züge (platoons). <i>Translator.</i></p>

<p><a id="Footnote34" href="#FNanchor34" class="label">&#8199;[34]</a> <span class="smcap">General Marmont</span>,
in his <cite>Esprit des Institutions Militaires</cite>, p. 41, states
that experience has shown that the most suitable strength for a troop is 48
files, divided into four platoons; but, he recommends that platoons should consist
of 16-18 files in order to maintain this strength throughout a campaign.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote35" href="#FNanchor35" class="label">&#8199;[35]</a> <i>Vorwerke.</i></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>While column tactics were in vogue, the above mentioned
requirements of a tactical unit were completely fulfilled by
the battalion, but this is no longer the case. It is quite impossible
for one voice to control the movements of a battalion
in action; this is scarcely possible in case of a company.
On the other hand, a company is too weak to carry out an
independent mission in action. Nothing less than a battalion
possesses the requisite fighting power, strength, and capacity
for subdivision, to sustain an action independently, to solve
minor problems of combat, and to remain a body full of
fighting efficiency even after sustaining serious losses such as
are unavoidable in every modern infantry action.</p>

<p>To attempt a further definition of the term “tactical
unit” would be of little value. General von Scherff in a
logical manner<a id="FNanchor36" href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> constructs a “troop
unit”<a id="FNanchor37" href="#Footnote37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> from “fighting
groups”<a id="FNanchor38" href="#Footnote38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> (squad of infantry or cavalry, or one gun), several
of which form a “fighting unit”<a id="FNanchor39" href="#Footnote39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> (company, troop or
battery), “possessing the requisite power to carry out a specific
task,” and placed under the command of a responsible
leader. “The definition of a fighting unit includes, on principle,
its indivisibility in action. Dispersion is a crime, division<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
at least an evil.” The “combat unit”<a id="FNanchor40" href="#Footnote40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> consists of a
number of fighting units. “The commander of the combat
unit (infantry battalion, cavalry regiment, or artillery battalion)
should be able to lead it as a compact entity, and
should have the power of employing its component parts
independently for combined action against some point.” General
von Scherff has found imitators in Austria, where the
term body of troops (<i>Truppenkörper</i>) is applied to an organization
having the necessary means for feeding, clothing,
and equipping the men, and which is composed of a number
of “basic units.”<a id="FNanchor41" href="#Footnote41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Such “basic units” as can be supervised,
handled, and controlled directly by one leader, who knows the
individual men thereof and their characteristics, are the troop
(<i>Eskadron</i>), battery, and company. Von Boguslawski<a id="FNanchor42" href="#Footnote42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> applies
the term “fighting unit” to organizations from the
company (troop) to the brigade, which act in accordance
with the tactics of their arm, supported by the other arms,
in the sphere assigned to them by orders or by circumstances.
Divisions, which, by the coöperation of the three
arms, are capable of independent employment on the march
and in action, he calls “combat units.” According to Boguslawski,
army corps are “battle units,”<a id="FNanchor43" href="#Footnote43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> with which the commander
reckons in battle, and which are strong enough to
meet an energetic attack or to execute one themselves.</p>

<h4>3. ORGANIZATION.</h4>

<p>The basic unit of infantry is the company, from 200 to
250 men strong in the larger armies. It seems hardly practicable
to exceed a strength of 150 men, as this is about
the greatest number in which a relation based upon personal
influence of the leader on his subordinates can still be obtained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
In armies in which companies are composed of more
than 200 men, the numbers in excess of this figure may be
regarded as a margin of safety, intended to maintain the
company at a strength of 200 rifles after the first casualties
of a campaign, produced by marching, detached service and
battle losses. In view of the losses, which frequently increase
with extraordinary rapidity in modern battles, it appears
undesirable to fix a lower figure than that above mentioned,
as the companies would otherwise lose their independence
and could no longer be considered basic units.</p>

<p>After the heavy losses at <b>St. Privat</b>, two companies were combined
into one for tactical purposes in some regiments of the Guard Corps.
The administration of the consolidated companies had to remain distinct
on account of the preparation of casualty lists, recommendations for promotion
and decorations. On the day of the battle of <b>Orleans</b>, the strength
of the German battalions varied from 459 men in the 1st Bavarian Army
Corps to 747 men in the 40th Infantry Brigade. During the pursuit after
the battle of <b>Le Mans</b>, the strength of the 56th Füsilier-Battalion was even
reduced to 280 men.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The actual training of troops must be completed in
the company. Combat by an independent company is the exception;
combat by battalion the rule. By the consolidation
of four companies into one unit, the battalion, consisting of
800-1,000 rifles, is formed. The French Chasseur battalions
are the only ones that consist of six companies, because their
proposed independent employment, for instance, in mountain
warfare, makes it more often necessary to detach small units
than is the case in operations on more favorable terrain.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>As, in the course of time, the independence of companies in action
developed, and as the combat of the battalion as an entity was transformed
into combined action of the four companies, the strength of the
company increased from 120 to 250 rifles while the number of companies
in a battalion diminished. The battalion of Frederick the Great was
divided for administrative purposes into five companies and for tactical
purposes into eight <i>pelotons</i>. The battalion of the first empire consisted
of six <i>Füsilier</i> and two <i>Voltigeur</i> companies, and the Austrian battalion,
until the reorganization after 1866, consisted of six companies of which
each two formed a division. Until 1866 the six company battalion predominated
in the infantry of all European armies (France, Italy, Austria,
and the minor German states), but early in the seventies most of the
states adopted the four company battalion, Russia being the last to do
this (four line and one sharpshooter company). In the regulations of
1812, Prussia had adopted the four company battalion. The independent
employment of the four united sharpshooter platoons of a battalion was
the exception even during the campaign of 1866. At present only the
British battalion consists of eight companies, which cannot, however, be
said to possess a capacity for independent action on account of their
small size.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>In the four-company organization the battalion possesses
an asset which enables it to adapt itself easily to any
combat situation. The battalion organization is the outgrowth<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
of practical necessity; the regimental commander
cannot handle 12-16 companies without difficulty, and an
intermediate unit, the battalion, is necessary. The battalion
is the practical, and the regiment, consisting of 3 or 4 battalions,
the ideal unit. Regiments consisting of two battalions
do not possess the same advantages, as the regimental
staff becomes superfluous during each necessary division of
the regiment. Two battalion regiments do indeed facilitate
command; they are, however, more expensive in time of
peace and are of advantage in action only when formed into
brigades of six battalions each, in which case the commander
has a compactly organized reserve available.</p>

<p>“The regiment, by reason of its history, the uniformity
of its training, the <i>esprit de corps</i> of its officers, and its
division into three battalions&mdash;thereby facilitating subdivision&mdash;is
pre-eminently fitted for carrying out definite combat
tasks.” (Par. 470 German I. D. R.). A glance at the map
of the battle of Vionville (5B of the German General Staff
work on the Franco-German war) shows that regiments,
whenever they entered the field intact, fought as unbroken
units throughout the battle, whereas brigade organizations
were frequently broken up.</p>

<p>This breaking up of brigades is practically induced by
the two regiment brigade organization. (Par. 471 German
I. D. R.). When once the brigade commander has assigned
sections or points of attack to his regiments, there remains
very little for him to do. He can form a reserve only by
taking two battalions from one regiment, or one battalion
from each. The brigade is, however, not like the regiment,
an entity of bodies of troops, but a unit assembled for tactical
purposes, which may, without regard to the whole, be
increased or diminished by one or more battalions in case
of necessity. On the march and in action the brigade organization
as a subdivision of the division cannot always be
maintained; groups are frequently formed in which the normal<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
units must be broken up. In large battles the brigade is
the largest force which may yet be employed as an intact unit,
although the employment of infantry by regiments will continue
to be the rule. Brigade commanders are necessary for
decreasing units of command and desirable for relieving the
division commanders of a part of their work. In time of
peace brigade commanders are useful for directing recruitment
and, moreover, as connecting links between regiments
and the division. The unmistakable advantages of the three-battalion
organization have induced the United States to
form its brigades of three regiments, each of three battalions
(of 400 men each). An English division consists of three
brigades of four battalions each.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote45" href="#FNanchor45" class="label">&#8199;[45]</a> In the Russo-Japanese war the Russian companies were equipped with 80
small spades and 20 hand axes; the Japanese companies with 68 small spades,
17 mattocks, 8 hatchets, and 30 wire cutters.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Earth as a covering material and, incidental thereto, the
adoption of the small spade after the Russo-Turkish war,
have increased in importance owing to the greater penetrating
power of the modern infantry bullets. The disadvantages
of the spade lie in the danger of its being misused and
in the consequent impairment of offensive spirit. There is,
moreover, danger that the fire effect will be impaired and
subordinated to considerations of cover. The spade should
therefore not be employed on every occasion, but only when
the tactical purpose in view requires it.</p>

<p>What the weight of the portable intrenching equipment
of the Japanese, Russian, and British infantry will be, is still
undecided, but experiments are being made with a uniform
tool. When we consider, that for the purpose of intrenching,
one man requires a space of 1.20 m., and for handling his
rifle a space of 0.8 m., and that when intrenching under fire
all the men cannot work, it is obvious that it would be impracticable<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
to equip each man with an intrenching tool. According
to all experience, it is sufficient to furnish every
other man with spade or pick. In addition to this, however,
a company requires a large number of wire cutters. Only the
French infantry is equipped with explosives, every regiment
having 108 cartridges.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">II. THE FORMATIONS.</h3>

<h4>1. THE ISSUE OF ORDERS.</h4>

<p>Troops are set in motion by words of command, and,
when these do not suffice, by orders. (Orders give information
of the situation and the intentions of the commander,
and assign tasks, but leave the recipient free to choose the
method of carrying them out). When commands are given
from a distance, time and energy may be saved by employing
the telephone and visual signals. To these may be added shouts,
signs, and the following signals: <i>To advance</i>, the leader raises
the arm; to indicate that the command is <i>to follow him</i>,
he extends his raised arm in the direction of march; <i>to halt</i>,
he lowers the arm; <i>to deploy</i>, both arms are raised laterally
to the height of the shoulders, and if necessary the direction
the skirmish line is to take is subsequently indicated
with one extended arm; <i>to assemble</i> his men, the leader describes
a circle above his head with one arm. These signals
may also be made with the sabre or rifle. Additional
signals should be agreed upon beforehand in each separate
case. If a signal is made to a body of troops in close order,
it is meant, in the first place, for its leader. (Par. 11 German
I. D. R.). Other signals, such as those indicating a change
of direction of march, or a change in the battle formation,
must be specially agreed upon beforehand. Trumpet signals
are only used by troops in garrison at drills, and in
barracks or billets as service calls. To prevent troops from
misunderstanding signals or from obeying those not intended
for them, all trumpet calls in battle, except “charge,” “fix
bayonet,” and “attention,” are forbidden.</p>

<h4>2. THE PURPOSE OF FORMATIONS. COMPARISON
BETWEEN LINE AND COLUMN.</h4>

<p>The object of assembly formations is to unite troops,
usually prior to a movement, in a restricted space permitting
an easy survey of the entire body. Assembly formations
serve also the purpose of placing troops in readiness before
starting on a march, before beginning an action, and for
moving them on the battlefield when out of reach of hostile
fire (columns). Route formations should permit
an orderly, comfortable march of the troops, as much of the
available width of road being used as possible, a space being<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
left for orderlies and mounted messengers, and for troops
which are drawn forward. In order to permit a prompt deployment
of troops for action, it is necessary to reduce their
depth. Columns only are suitable for moving troops. The
situation existing at the moment will determine to what extent
allowances may be made for the comfort of the troops,
or how far considerations of comfort should be ignored in
view of readiness for action, and to what extent the depth
of the columns should be decreased.</p>

<p>The formations for moving troops (to be employed in
marching across country and to be used on the battlefield)
should be such as to cause the least discomfort to the troops,
should make it possible to avoid obstacles, to utilize cover, facilitate
changes of front and direction of march, and permit
a prompt deployment in any direction. These formations
are columns unless the hostile fire effect makes a deployment
into line necessary.</p>

<p>Battle formations should be such as to permit the employment
of all weapons (rifles, lances, sabres, and guns).
This requirement is not satisfied by columns, but only by the
line. Modern fire effect excludes every employment of close
order formations under effective hostile fire and compels the
most extensive deployment.</p>

<p>Whether line or column is the preferable battle formation
is a question belonging to a bygone age. The battles of
the British in Spain and at Waterloo, the engagement at
Groszbeeren, and the attack of the six battalions of Borke’s
Brigade (the 8th) at the Katzbach,<a id="FNanchor61" href="#Footnote61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> amply demonstrate that
the defeat of the Prussians at Jena was not due to the employment
of linear battle formations alone. In a fight with
an equal opponent, formed in columns, well trained and disciplined
troops, formed in line that allows of the use of all
the rifles and is suitable for shock action as well, have always
carried off the victory.<a id="FNanchor62" href="#Footnote62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
On the other hand, in the battles<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
of the Empire we find columns formed, which of necessity
excluded a large part of the men from participation in
the action, but which were designed to break through the hostile
battle line by sheer momentum. At Wagram, Macdonald’s
Corps was formed with eight deployed battalions in
rear of each other in a single column, supported on the
flanks by seven and eight battalions respectively, also in
column. At Austerlitz and Waterloo we find attack formations
in which from eight to twelve battalions of a division
were deployed one in rear of the other at distances of twenty

their mobility, their vulnerability and their fire and shock

<p>The column possesses greater mobility and is better
adapted than the line for executing changes of front and
for taking advantage of the cover afforded by the ground.
In a column steadiness and shock power (produced by the
crowding forward of the ranks in rear) and the influence
exerted by the officers, is greater than in a line.</p>

<p>The line is more dependent on the terrain in its movements.
The characteristics of the line are great frontal
fire power, weakness of the flanks, difficulty of quickly
changing front, and the ever present danger of being pierced.
The line has been called the formation of the bold, the
column that of the weak.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The column<a id="FNanchor63" href="#Footnote63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> was proposed as a battle formation in France as early
as 1774 by Mesnil Durand, but did not find practical application until the
wars of the Revolution. In those wars columns were used because the
raw levies lacked the training necessary for making movements in line.
Whenever a line formation was used, battalions, owing to the scarcity of
efficient officers, resolved themselves into disorderly skirmish lines which
were exceedingly difficult to control. The adoption of the column was,
therefore, the result of practical experience, but as a formation it could
be justified on the battlefield only so long as it remained capable of development
for the purpose of firing. The endeavor to combine the advantages
of column and line by a combination of both formations led to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
placing of columns in rear of the wings of the battalions deployed in line.
This formation was employed for the first time in the attack made by a
demi-brigade during the battle on the <b>Tagliamento</b> (1797), and subsequently
it was used at <b>Marengo</b> (attack made by Desaix’s Division).</p>

<p>On account of the increased penetrating power of infantry
projectiles, especially at short ranges, a column will
suffer greater losses than a line; at longer ranges the curvature
of the trajectory causes bullets which pass over the first
echelon to strike the second or third. On ground falling with
respect to the line of sight, lines, and on ground rising with
respect to the line of sight, columns are exposed to greater

<h4>3. THE COMPANY.</h4>

<h5>(a) Formation of the Company.<br />
<span class="nonbold">(Par. 83 German I. D. R.).</span></h5>

<p>In the company the files are placed in two ranks according
to height from right to left. Each four files form a
squad or group, and the entire company is divided into three
platoons (<i>Züge</i>). When a platoon consists of more than
three squads it is divided into two sections (<i>Halbzüge</i>).</p>

<p>In the normal formation of the company, the three
platoons, each in two ranks,<a id="FNanchor65" href="#Footnote65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> are posted on a line in numerical
order from right to left. This formation facilitates firing
and in garrison meets the requirements of barrack life, each
two squads forming a section (<i>Korporalschaft</i>) under a non-commissioned
officer. During the campaign of 1866 Prince
Frederick Charles gave permission to arrange companies so
that friends and relatives could serve together in the same
squad or section. A company formed in this fashion would,
of course, not look so well on parade as one formed regularly,
the men according to height from right to left flank,
but it would without doubt give a better account of itself in
action. For details of the formation of a company and division
into fractions see pars. 82-85, German I. D. R. The
squad leaders and the two range finders in each platoon are<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
posted as file closers at facing distance in rear of the rear
rank of the company.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote65" href="#FNanchor65" class="label">&#8199;[65]</a> The number of ranks is intimately related to the rate of fire of the infantry
weapon. During the days of slow loading, the necessity of keeping at least a
part of the rifles at all times ready for firing led the Imperialists in the Thirty
Years’ war (loading was executed by 90 motions) to form their musketeers into
sixteen ranks, while Gustavus Adolphus was able to form his infantry into six
ranks owing to the greater loading facility of their rifles. In the Seven Years’
war the Prussian infantry was formed in three, that of the Austrians in four
ranks, the fourth rank serving as a reserve. The first rank fired kneeling. The
British infantry was the first to adopt the two rank formation for fire action,
forming into four ranks for shock action and frequently for warding off cavalry
attacks. Emperor Napoleon considered a third rank useless for fire and shock
action and initiated the double rank formation on the eve of the battle of
Leipzig. In 1888 the Prussian infantry&mdash;the last to do so&mdash;gave up the three
rank formation which had long since lost its importance in battle and which
was retained side by side with the double rank formation for purposes of parade
only.</p>

<p>The <i>non-commissioned officers</i> are posted in the front
rank, on the flanks and in the center of the platoons in
Russia, Austria, and Switzerland. In Germany and Italy
they are all posted in rear of the line as file closers, and it
is their duty to supervise the men. In France a part of the
non-commissioned officers are posted in the front rank, the
remainder as file closers. A German company of 200 men
has a front of 100 paces, or 80 m. The infantryman with
field equipment occupies a space about 75 cm. square.</p>

flank of the element on the left (or vice versa); and distance in the

<h5><b>(b) Division of the Company Into Three or Four
Platoons.</b></h5>

<p>In Austria, France, and Italy, platoons are considered
as distinct bodies, so long as they have sufficient numerical
strength. They are placed side by side and constitute the
company in line. In Germany and Russia the company is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
each formation divided into platoons of approximately equal
strength. In the armies of Austria, France, and Italy, it is
contended that the soldier has nothing further to learn when
once he is taken up for duty in the company. All movements
are executed, after preparatory commands given by the
company commanders, by commands of execution or signals
given by platoon commanders. The execution of movements
is retarded by this procedure and the movement itself
becomes clumsy. It would also seem that the multiplicity of
commands in the simple, oft-repeated movements, is superfluous,
especially in the weak platoons at peace strength.</p>

<p>Column of platoons from line (par. 121 German I. D. R.: “Form
column of platoons”) is formed in Austria as follows (Austrian I. D. R.
par. 360): At the preparatory command, “Column,” given by the company
commander, the leaders of the 1st, 3rd, and 4th platoons command at
once, as in forming column of fours to the front, “Fours right (left),
column right (left).” At the command “march,” the platoons step off,
each turning in column to the rear, and are conducted to their new
positions, halted, and dressed to the right (left).</p>

<p>The companies of all powers, those of Germany, Japan,
and Belgium excepted, are divided into four platoons; each
two platoons may in addition be combined into a half-company.
The German, Japanese, and Belgian companies are divided
into three platoons. “The platoon is not an independent
subdivision by reason of the mere fact that it consists of
a certain number of men, but because the term platoon denotes
a force led by a man of superior intelligence. The officer
commanding the platoon makes it what it should be.
The strength of the platoon is therefore solely dependent
upon the number of officers available.” (<span class="smcap">von Scherff</span>).</p>

<p>The obvious advantage of the three-platoon organization
of the company is that fewer platoon commanders are required,
which fact is well worthy of attention in the mobilization
of units of both Line and Reserve, especially in view of
the extraordinarily heavy casualties among the troop leaders
in the course of a campaign.<a id="FNanchor66" href="#Footnote66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

had only 108 officers left; companies and even half-battalions were led

<p>On the other hand, it should be remembered that in
armies consisting of militia it is considerably more difficult
to command a platoon of 60-70 men than to command one
of 40-50 men. A disadvantage inseparably connected with
the four-platoon company is the small size of the platoons
during peace exercises. On account of this circumstance
most regulations permit the three-platoon formation when
the company is small, because platoons consisting of less than
ten files are of no instructional value. An advantage of the
three-platoon company is the simplicity and rapidity with
which changes from one formation to another may be effected.</p>

<p>The three-unit column of platoons is very broad for
movements on the battlefield. It offers, when numbering 200
rifles, a target about 25 m. wide and only 15 m. deep. The
four-unit column of platoons is better suited for movements.
With a front of 17 m., its depth is only 15 m., when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
distances between platoons are assumed to be 6 paces (Austria,
France, Italy, Russia, 5 paces). (See <a href="#Page62">p. 62</a>).</p>

<p>For a company consisting of 200 rifles, the following
would be the forms:</p>

<div class="container w35em">

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo052.png" alt="Platoon widths" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The other advantages praised by advocates of the four-unit
company are:</p>

<p>1. That a smaller platoon is more suitable for field
service&mdash;that a picket is perhaps only in the rarest cases to be
made 60 men strong.</p>

<p>2. That a small platoon makes a better and more comprehensive
employment of the company in action possible, as
the company commander has an opportunity to use <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>, or
<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> of his company according to the requirements of the situation,
while the three-unit company affords less favorable
combinations, permitting only an employment of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> or <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>
of its strength.</p>

<p>These advantages can also be obtained in the German
company by the employment of sections (<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>,
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>, <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>, <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>,
<sup>5</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>) so that the objections to the three-unit company would
appear to be groundless.</p>

<p>The platoons (in Italy called <i>plotone</i>, in France, <i>section</i>)
are subdivided into sections (<i>demi-sections</i>, <i>Halbzüge</i>),
in Austria into two skirmish groups (<i>Schwärme</i>) of 4-7
files each, and, when consisting of 16 files, into four skirmish
groups (in Italy this is also done, the groups being called
<i>squadriglio</i>). In Germany the platoons are divided into<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
groups or squads of four files each, and in Russia the platoons
are divided into sections of 8-15 files each and these again
into groups or squads of 4-6 men each. If the squad is
to have any importance at all in action, it must have a
leader, and it might easily happen that a mobilized company
lacks the number of leaders necessary to provide one for
each group. The withdrawal from the line of a number
of good shots for duty as squad leaders is compensated
for, in our opinion, by the more thorough supervision
over the men. This consideration has, however, apparently
caused other states (Austria and France) not to count
on the activity of the squad leaders in a fire action to the
same extent as is the case in Germany.</p>

<h4>4. LENGTH OF PACE AND MARCHING.</h4>

<p>An extended, swinging step, without haste and without
unduly taxing the lungs, is advantageous in all movements.
When accustomed to this pace on the drill ground, the men
will march with practically the same step on varied ground,
and this appears more desirable than to shorten the step,
while at the same time increasing the distance to be covered
in a given time. The length of the pace depends largely
upon the height of the individual, but even small men can
maintain a step of 0.80 m. without undue exertion.<a id="FNanchor71" href="#Footnote71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> In
Switzerland the cadence has been fixed at 116-120 steps per
minute “with a view of suiting the peculiarities and the varying
degree of mobility which characterize the inhabitants of
the different cantons.”(!) For purely practical reasons it is
advisable to fix upon some even number of paces in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
that the cadence may be tested with the watch. (Austria
excepted). The longest pace in conjunction with the highest
cadence (<i>Bersaglieri</i>, whose march is almost a double time,
excepted) is found in England and Switzerland. Such a
performance could not be kept up by a fully equipped man
without impairing health.</p>

<p>In general, double time is considered of little value. In
Austria double time is to be maintained for periods of two
minutes, quick time of five minutes duration alternating, up
to sixteen minutes, <i>i.e.</i>, until a distance of 1,726 m. has
been covered. In Germany, an alternating quick and double
time march in heavy marching order is prescribed. A
different practice prevails in Italy. According to the Italian
Regulations all troops are to be trained to march in
double time without rest and without knapsacks for 2 kilometers
(with knapsacks, 1 km.); <i>Bersaglieri</i> without knapsacks,
3 km. (with knapsacks, 1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> km.), also without rest
(<i>i.e.</i>, 13 and 16.8 minutes respectively). When we consider
that in double time with the necessary alternating step,
2,000 m. can be covered in 17 minutes, and in accelerated
step, in 19-20 minutes, the time gained is unimportant when
compared to the fatigue of the men and the exertion of the
lungs, which interferes with deliberate, accurate firing. During
an Austrian firing test the number of hits fell from
76.5%, attained while advancing in quick time, to 51% after
a period of double time.</p>

<p>The run, without keeping step (<i>Marsch! Marsch!</i>) is
employed in rapidly crossing short, fire-swept spaces, in
changing quickly from one formation to another, and in the
charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span></p>

<h4>5. MOVEMENTS OF THE COMPANY IN LINE.</h4>

<p>The commander of the center platoon is the guide.</p>

<p>A change of direction is effected by inclining toward
the new direction (at the command: “Half right, march!”
when the angular change of direction is less than 45 degrees),
by indicating a new point to march on, or by executing a
turn.</p>

<h4>6. THE COLUMNS OF THE COMPANY; MOVEMENTS
IN COLUMN; FORMATION OF LINE.</h4>

<h5>Column of Twos.<a id="FNanchor73" href="#Footnote73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></h5>

<p>Column of twos is formed by facing in the indicated
direction. Marching at attention the depth of an organization
in column of twos is equal to its front when in line.
The column of twos is used in marching by the flank for
short distances only, as the march at attention in this formation
unduly fatigues the men. In addition, this formation
may be used, in exceptional cases, on narrow roads; but the
column becomes considerably elongated (as much as 165%),
when marching at route step. Line is formed from column
of twos either by facing, or by executing front into
line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span></p>

<h5>Column of Squads.</h5>

<p>This is an open column
formed (the company
being in line at
a halt or in motion) by
each squad executing
a turn of 90 degrees.
It may also be formed
from line at a halt by
the squad on the designated
flank moving
straight to the front,
the others executing
a turn of 90 degrees
toward the proper
flank, then following
the leading squad.<a id="FNanchor74" href="#Footnote74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Column of squads may
also be formed by executing
“Squads right
(left), column right
(left).” Line is formed
by each squad executing
a turn of 90 degrees
or by executing
front into line (without
regard to the
original front).</p>

<p>Route column is
formed from column
of squads by the
squads in each section
closing to facing distance,
the file closers,
musicians, and hospital
corps men forming
ranks of four
men, in the gaps thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
created. (Par. 91 German I. D. R.) With the exception
of Russia, which employs a section column, of Switzerland,
which uses a column of squads, and of France, which has
adopted a wheel by fours like that of the cavalry, all other
armies employ the <i>column of fours</i><a id="FNanchor75" href="#Footnote75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> as their march formation.</p>

<p>Column of fours is, as a rule, formed as follows:</p>

<p>The even numbered men place themselves on the right
or left of the odd numbered men by making an appropriate
turn, thus forming a column of fours whose length is equal
to the front of the company in line. In the plate below
let the Roman numerals represent front rank men, the Arabic
numerals rear rank men, and the horizontal line the original
front occupied; column of fours will then be formed to the
right, in the different states, as shown:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span></p>

<p>For the purpose of increasing the front of the column,
the double column of squads, having a width of 8 files, may
be employed. This is formed in practice by placing the
columns of two organizations (companies or battalions) side
by side. In large bodies of troops, the depth of a column
is reduced in this manner by one-half. A column of fours
formed by closing on the center instead of by wheeling to
a flank, is employed in Italy and Russia for the purpose of
reducing the front of an organization.</p>

<h5>Comparison of Column of Fours with Column of Squads.</h5>

<p>The column of fours has the advantage over our column
of squads in that it can be more quickly and easily formed;
that the front rank men must make a turn, while, at the
same time, observing the march direction, can scarcely be
considered a disadvantage.</p>

<p>The column of fours and the column of squads have
the same depth. The Austrians consider movements made
in column of fours on the battlefield more clumsy and
fatiguing than when made in column of squads, because
checks are transmitted to the whole column of fours owing
to its rigidity, while in column of squads the march is easier,
more rapid and more orderly. The squad organization, moreover,
facilitates the employment of small parties in the service
of security and increases the importance of the squad leader
in fire action. For the last named reason we should not like
to dispense with the column of squads.</p>

<h5>The Employment of the Column of Squads.</h5>

<p>The route column is suitable for movements under
frontal artillery fire, as the cone of dispersion of bursting
time shrapnel combines small lateral spread with great effect
in the direction of depth, and as it is very difficult for the
opponent to observe whether a shot falls short or goes over,
unless it strikes just in front of the column. When artillery
can bring a flanking fire to bear on the column it becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
necessary to neutralize this by placing the platoons side by side
so as not to present an easily observed target to the enemy.</p>

<p>Movements by the flank and changes of front are easily
made in column of squads, and after some practice the deployment
into line of skirmishers from this formation offers no
difficulties. This column is best adapted for movements over
varied ground. In column of squads difficult terrain can be
crossed and advantage can be taken of the most insignificant
cover. In addition, it is difficult for an enemy to observe a
force moving in column of squads along the edge of woods
and rows of trees, and such a column entails the least
expenditure of energy on the part of the men. The leaders
must insist, however, that the men cover in file, and that
elongation of the column does not take place. The column of
squads or the route column is therefore to be employed on
the battlefield as long as possible.</p>

<p>A column of squads or route column may be shortened
by placing the platoons, each in column of twos or squads,
side by side. By this means the <b>Company Column</b> (<i>Kompagniekolonne</i>)
is formed.</p>

<div class="container w20em">

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo060.png" alt="Company Column" />

</div><!--container-->

<p>The normal interval between
platoons in this formation, measured
from the leading guide of one
platoon to the leading guide of the
next in line, is nine paces. This interval
may be increased as required
by the nature of the ground and
the intended deployment for action
(deployment on a broader front).
Movements in company column are
facilitated by the fact that platoon
commanders are posted four paces
in front of the center of their respective
platoons. The leading
squad follows the platoon leader,
the guide of that squad moving directly
in that officer’s tracks. Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
small, unimportant deviations, unavoidable on varied ground, can
easily be adjusted, while too definite rules would tend to restrict
the mobility of the platoon commanders in front of their
platoons. The principal thing is that the platoon follow its
leader who guides it without command.</p>

<p>The musicians distribute themselves in rear of the platoons
in readiness for their subsequent duty in action&mdash;that of
maintaining communication between the several parts of the
company. The intervals of nine paces between platoons are
not rigid, but rather the reverse. The flexibility of the formation
considerably facilitates movements in difficult country.
This “meandering” of the company over the terrain requires
special training. The old, historic company column, in which
the platoons were formed in line one in rear of the other
at a distance of nine paces (Russia 5 paces = 3.55 m., Austria,
Italy, France, 6 paces = 4.50 m., and Japan, 8 paces = 6 m.),
their commanders on their respective right flanks, is now
called the</p>

<h5>Column of Platoons.</h5>

<p>Austria, France, and Italy have retained the old designation.</p>

<p>The front of the column of platoons may be decreased
by forming column of sections. The column of sections is
suitable as a route formation on broad roads; the transition
from column of sections to column of squads is not difficult,
and for the purpose of passing through occasional narrow
stretches of road, the files on the flanks may be removed. In
most cases it is, however, more desirable to place several
columns abreast than to employ column of sections, because
deployment is facilitated in the former case.</p>

<h5>Posts of Platoon Commanders.</h5>

<p>In Switzerland, in Russia, and in Germany, the post of
platoon commanders is on the flanks of their respective
platoons when the company is in column of platoons. In
England and Austria platoon commanders are posted in rear
of their platoons, with the exception of the commander of
the leading platoon, who is posted beside his guide. In all
other states platoon commanders are posted in front of their
platoons. Officers are posted in front of their platoons so
as to facilitate observation on their part, and so that their
platoons can follow them. This position becomes a necessity
when the regulations require that all movements of the company
be executed at commands given by platoon commanders.
When they are posted in front of their platoons, they cannot
supervise their men unless they turn around to do so.</p>

<p>The column of platoons is a close column from which
line cannot be formed directly. It has not been found necessary
in Germany to provide an open column permitting
prompt deployment toward a flank. The column of platoons
unites the company on the smallest space and facilitates supervision,
but in companies at full war strength it is not well
adapted for executing changes of front and for taking advantage
of cover, on account of the size of the platoons (40<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
files each). In platoons at war strength the men look more
toward the point upon which they are to march than upon
the enemy, and the deployment of the rear platoons offers
difficulties which occur principally when a deployment in an
oblique direction or one by the whole company becomes
necessary.</p>

<p>The column of platoons is formed by the flank platoons
placing themselves in rear of the center platoon. Line is
again formed by rear platoons moving to right and left and
abreast of the leading platoon.</p>

<p>The German company column is much more flexible, and
the advantage of a prompt deployment for action, made possible
by the fact that all platoon commanders and the heads
of platoons are in the lead and therefore can see the objective,
should not be underestimated. The company column is
formed from line by the center platoon forming column of
squads to the front (or rear), the flank platoons, each in
column of squads, closing on the center platoon, heads of the
three columns on the same line. Company column is formed
as follows from column of platoons: the leading platoon
executes squads right (left), column left (right), the two
rear platoons execute squads right (left), and are led to a
position abreast of the leading platoon. Company column
from column of squads is formed by rear platoons moving
to the right and left respectively, and abreast of the leading
platoon.</p>

<p>When line is to be formed from company column, the
flank platoons have to incline to the right and left respectively
in order to gain sufficient interval.</p>

<h5>Movements in Column.</h5>

<p>For marching short distances to a flank, column of twos
may be employed; for longer distances, column of squads
(or fours); and the march direction may be changed by
inclining in the proper direction.</p>

<p>Since March 1904, experiments, which deserve to be
mentioned here, have been made in France under the direction
of Colonel Fumet, having for their object the simplification
of the drill regulations. In the experiments a four-rank formation
is being considered. In this proposed scheme the
platoon is formed so as to place the four single-rank squads
(<i>escouades</i>) in rear of each other at the very close facing
distance of 0.50 m., the leaders of the <i>escouades</i> taking post
on the right flank, a first class private being posted on each
flank and in the center of each <i>escouade</i>.</p>

<p>The platoon at war strength (50 men) has a front of 8-10 m.
and a depth of 3 m. The movements are very simple.
Route column is formed by simply facing to flank, without first
dividing the platoon into squads. Double rank line may be
formed from column of fours, by executing right and left
front into line. The double rank line may be deployed into
half-platoons. Furthermore, a single rank line may be formed
by the men of the rear rank stepping up into the front
rank. One drawback of this scheme is, that, in forming
route column, facing distance of 0.80 m. between ranks is to
be gradually gained after stepping off. The deployment of
half-platoons into line of skirmishers offers no difficulties.
It is otherwise, however, when the platoon is formed in four
ranks and marching in platoon front, for then line of skirmishers
can be formed only by deploying each rank in turn.
The depth of the column may be decreased by placing
platoons (formed in column of twos or fours) abreast, this
expedient affording a suitable route formation on broad
roads. The company is formed by placing the platoons on
a line and abreast of each other at intervals of 2 m. In the
battalion, column of platoons and “mass” are the only formations
considered. In the “mass” formation the companies,
each in line, are in rear of each other.</p>

<h4>7. THE BATTALION.</h4>

<p>The movements of the battalion have been considerably
simplified in all armies. Battalion drill is, however, necessary,
since, as shown by the advance of the IInd Army on the
morning of August 18th, 1870, simultaneous movements of
large masses across country will be unavoidable in future
wars on account of the great size of modern armies.<a id="FNanchor76" href="#Footnote76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<h5>Normal Formation of the German Battalion.</h5>

</div>

<p>The deep column is employed for assembling troops if
the terrain necessitates a formation on a narrow front. If
sufficient distance is allowed between companies, line may be
formed to a flank, but this increases the depth of the column
to such an extent that movements at attention are impossible.
The deep column may be used as a route formation in addition
to the column of squads. During the change from route
formation to that of action, the deep column formation may
be retained so long as the depth of the whole column does
not have to be further reduced. When necessary, the deep
column may be replaced by a formation in which the four
companies, each in route column, are placed abreast of each
other.</p>

<p>The broad column finds proper employment, aside from
parades, in cases where the terrain or the contemplated
deployment requires more front than depth. It is also advisable
to assemble the widely scattered troops in a broad column
after an action. The broad column does not lend itself,
however, to the execution of changes of front by battalion;
but should such changes of front become necessary,
they are always to be executed by company.</p>

<p>The color is posted between the right and
left center companies, in broad column, and on
the right flank of the third company, in deep
column. In action the color remains with the
company with which it happens to be at the moment.<a id="FNanchor77" href="#Footnote77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Should this company also join the firing
line, the color accompanies it; but under all circumstances
one squad must remain with the
color. (Par. 236 German I. D. R.). It has been
contended that this is a disadvantage, as the
enemy can direct his fire on the color and the
men in its vicinity. If the colors, upon which
the soldiers have been sworn, are taken into the
field, it is always better to endure the unavoidable
losses incidental to carrying them, and even to expose
them to capture, than to send them back to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
safe place under escort.<a id="FNanchor78" href="#Footnote78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> At the Albrechtshaus farm

with the color, and a squad of the Füsilier-Battalion of the 46th Infantry finally
had six colors to guard. In the 88th Infantry, out of a total of 48 sections,
9 sections remained in rear as a guard for 2 colors, but finally 6 of these
sections crossed the Sauer.</p>

<p>Opinions are divided as to the value of the double
column. Formerly, when the double column was still the
column of attack from which deployment for fire action had
to be made, a discussion of its merits was of special importance.
While Austria abandoned the double column formation
in 1881 and Germany in 1905, Switzerland replaced it
by a column having a front of two platoons (<i>Plotonkolonne</i>),
and Russia readopted it again recently. All other states
utilize it as of equal value with the deep column in making
movements beyond range of artillery fire and as an assembly
formation in addition to the deep column. The change
from double column to any company column formation is
easier than a like change from the Swiss “Ploton column”
(double column of platoons), which has the same front,
since in the double column two companies can be deployed
at the same time toward both flanks.</p>

<p>The deep column appears to be better adapted for making
movements and for advancing under cover, and, on account
of its narrow front, a force in this formation is better
able to adapt itself to the forms of the ground in hilly or
close country than a body of troops in double column of
twice the width of front.</p>

columns given and not in the distances. A permanent extension
of distances for the purpose of restricting checks of the
march to a single organization is as little permissible as the
permanent elimination or reduction of distances; distances
may be dispensed with temporarily only. The reduction of
the depth of a column, obtained by eliminating distances
between elements entirely, is so small that the rapidity of
deployment gained does not, by any means, compensate for
the increased exertion of the troops.<a id="FNanchor82" href="#Footnote82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<h4>8. THE REGIMENT AND THE BRIGADE.</h4>

<p>For a discussion of the importance of the regiment and
of the brigade see <a href="#Page37">page 37</a> <i>supra</i>. All movements must
be executed in an orderly manner by regiment and brigade,
in any formation, without breaking up tactical units, and the
entity of the whole body must be preserved at the same
time by a skillful use of the terrain. If necessary, a base
battalion may be designated.</p>

<p>When regiments or brigades are assembled, the formation,
disposition, intervals and distances of the tactical units
depend upon the terrain and the intentions of the commander.
Frequently the tactical units (battalions and regiments)
are assembled in separate groups.</p>

<p>When considerations of the enemy and the terrain do
not dictate otherwise, the battalions, each, as a rule, in deep
column, are posted in one or more lines, at 30-pace intervals
and distances, rear battalions covering those in front or the
gaps between them. An appropriate formation will frequently
be that in which route columns are placed abreast and
on the same line.</p>

<p>In the brigade, when assembled or deployed, the regiments
may be placed abreast of each other, on the same line,
or in rear of each other, <i>i.e.</i>, in line or in echelon. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span>
the regiments are formed side by side, two adjacent independent
sections are created, each commanded by a regimental
commander; this insures better supervision, better
control, and a more energetic conduct of the action, since the
first line can be reinforced by troops belonging to the same
organization. This formation, moreover, facilitates tactical
combinations. It may, however, be a disadvantage that the
first line is not subject to the orders of a single commander;
that it is difficult to employ the reserve battalions in one
body; and that the brigade commander can influence the
action only by withdrawing units from the regiments for the
purpose of forming a reserve.<a id="FNanchor83" href="#Footnote83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The echelon formation, each
echelon consisting of a regiment, is frequently used in
rencontres, because troops are thrown into action directly from
route column. The regimental commanders then become
leaders of echelons, the first line cannot be reinforced by its
own troops, and the organizations of different regiments
finally become mixed. The echelon formation is proper only
when the second line is intended to be used independently
abreast of the first in the course of the action; for example,
on a flank, for the purpose of making or warding off a flank
attack.<a id="FNanchor84" href="#Footnote84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> When part of a larger force, the most suitable
combat formation for troops is usually the one in which the
regiments are formed side by side.</p>

The fight of François’ Brigade at Spicheren. <cite>Gen. St. W.</cite> I, p. 310, et seq.
The formation, side by side, of the six battalions of the IIIrd Army Corps in the
attack on the hill at Forbach (Spicheren) would have been inappropriate and
would have disrupted all organizations.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The disadvantages of the echelon formation, when taken
up from route column, can be obviated by deploying the
second regiment in rear of a flank of the first. It should be
kept intact in that position until the decisive moment, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
the state of the fight may, at the outset, invite a more rapid
extension of front.</p>

<h4>9. EXTENDED ORDER.</h4>

<p>Combats are begun and carried out in extended order.
The defender can be induced to disclose his dispositions, to
occupy his position, and to open fire, only by the advance
upon him of a skirmish line. The deployment of a thin firing
line will frequently suffice to furnish the commander of the
attacking force with a clue to the strength of the force holding
the hostile position. In close country, skirmishers are
pushed forward primarily to guard against surprise the force
which sends them out, but when thrown forward only a few
hundred meters in open country, such skirmishers are unable
to furnish protection. The strength and density of a firing
line (by means of which the fight is sustained) depend upon
marksmanship, upon the purpose of the action, and upon the
terrain. The poorer the marksmanship or the weapon, or the
more unfavorable the field of fire, the greater the number of
skirmishers needed (<i>i.e.</i>, the denser the firing line).<a id="FNanchor85" href="#Footnote85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> If the
enemy is merely to be kept at a distance, less skirmishers
(<i>i.e.</i>, a thinner firing line furnished with plenty of ammunition)
will be required, than if the action is to be carried to
a decisive conclusion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote85" href="#FNanchor85" class="label">&#8199;[85]</a> The Boers with their superior weapons and better marksmanship, and
further because they never cared to become involved in a fight at close quarters,
found thin firing lines sufficient.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Cohesion and order are best maintained, and the least
time is lost in action, if efficient, dense firing lines are led
forward as units up to the moment of opening fire. (Pars.
169, 321, 334 and 413 German I. D. R.). But on open terrain
such dense firing lines would begin to suffer too great a
loss at ranges at which they could not reply to the fire. Nothing
remains then but to cover the available front with a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
thin firing line, followed at irregular distances by thin
skirmish lines which ploy for the purpose of utilizing cover or
for opening fire. Skirmish lines of this description will hardly
justify the opponent’s expenditure of ammunition, as he can
only cover broad spaces with volley fire. On the other hand,
these skirmish lines are in themselves too weak to facilitate
the approach of the following echelons by their fire. Besides,
it must not be overlooked that the soldier, separated by a
considerable interval from his comrades in line during the
advance, and withdrawn from the influence of his officers,
succumbs more easily to temporary spells of weakness and is
more apt to remain behind than the skirmisher in a dense
firing line. The advance in several successive, thin skirmish
lines is therefore only an expedient. In each case the leaders
will have to decide whether, in view of the close proximity
of the enemy, a united advance with dense, powerful skirmish
lines is possible or advisable (for instance, when entering
at once upon the decisive stage of the action). Before
opening fire the firing lines must be sufficiently reinforced.
(Par. 334 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>This advance in thin skirmish lines stood the test both
in the Boer war and in the Russo-Japanese war,<a id="FNanchor86" href="#Footnote86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> but we
must not forget that thin skirmish lines are only maneuver
formations in an attack that is to be pushed home, and that
the mistake made by the British of attempting to make an
attack with such weak skirmish lines should not be imitated.
The Japanese also used this formation after they had once
opened fire with a dense skirmish line.<a id="FNanchor87" href="#Footnote87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

line, with the men approximately 3 paces apart, had been formed about 100-150
m. in front of the trench mentioned. The rest of the men, who until this moment
had remained in the trench, now rushed forward in groups of 5-10 men for distances
of 30 m., for the purpose of reaching the advanced line.”</p>

<p>The superior effect of fire on the dense skirmish line,
as expressed by the greater number of hits, and in consequence
thereof, by the gradually growing number of figures
hit, is apparent. It is worthy of note and at first glance
strange that, presupposing the two lines considered occupy
an equal front, the percentage of figures hit is the same. The
explanation of this lies in the fact that in correctly distributed
fire any specified front space is equally covered with
hits so that it is immaterial for the relative proportion of
figures hit whether an equal number of figures is removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
or added. While, however, the dense skirmish line still has
131 effectives, the weaker line has only 63 left. The casualties
are therefore far more perceptible in the smaller
force.</p>

<h5>(a) The Formation of the Skirmish Line.</h5>

<p>Skirmish line with intervals of two paces between the
men is formed at the command, “As Skirmishers.” (Pars.
142 and 174-180 German I. D. R.). The skirmish line may
be deployed from any formation, in any direction, either
with or without first changing front. (Par. 177 German
I. D. R.). A greater interval than two paces must be specifically
ordered. Squad leaders hasten in front of their squads
and form the framework of the skirmish line. The men
follow their squad leaders absolutely. When the terrain requires
it, squad leaders may increase or diminish intervals
without command. In other armies (for instance, in those
of Italy, France, and England) the desire to keep the skirmishers
under control as long as possible, has led to advancing
the platoons designated for the firing line at first in close
order, the deployment being made only when the state of
the action requires it. In France, the intervals between files
may be increased, or a single rank line may be formed
before the force is deployed as skirmishers. During an
advance it will often happen that intervals are increased or
diminished in accordance with the peculiarities of the terrain.
The advance is continued until the command or signal
“Halt” is given. If line of skirmishers is to be formed
when marching to the rear, the command is first faced to
the front and then deployed on the line then occupied.
(Rallying position, par. 180 German I. D. R.). On varied
ground, deployments will be made under cover whenever
possible in order to allow of an immediate advance in skirmish
line from that point. The number of platoons to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
deployed depends upon the tactical situation. When three
deployed platoons are formed abreast, it is difficult for the
company commander to control them; but this formation is
an appropriate one if a company is surprised or enters
immediately into decisive action, or in cases where the battalion
acting alone requires complete units in reserve for
additional tasks. (Pars. 462, 463 and 469 German I. D. R.).
When the battalion is engaged as part of a larger force, it is
a good plan to occupy all the available front space at once
with skirmishers and to maintain the intensity of fire of the
firing line by constantly reinforcing it. The losses are less
in this case than when the men crowd together in groups.
(Italy).</p>

<p>Platoon and squad leaders are posted on the side of
their commands facing the enemy while advancing; in moving
to the rear, squad leaders are posted on the side away
from the enemy, their duty being to maintain the march
direction, and the platoon commanders remain in rear of their
platoons (<i>i.e.</i>, on the side toward the enemy). Russia is
the only country where the leaders of a firing line are posted
in the rear. In Austria one non-commissioned officer in
each platoon is designated to march in rear of the advancing
firing line for the purpose of supervising the skirmishers.
As this non-commissioned officer is to prevent straggling, he
should be selected with great care.</p>

<p>The platoon commander indicates the march direction
to the leader of the base squad, and, accompanied by the
range finders and the musicians, moves to a point at least
ten paces in front of the line of his squad leaders, as a
rule, opposite the center of his platoon; but he is not restricted
to this position. He must possess mobility if he desires to
lead his platoon skillfully on varied ground, if he expects to
avoid interfering with neighboring platoons, and if he wishes
to observe the enemy at the same time. The musician keeps
the company commander constantly in view. (Par. 221<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
German I. D. R.). The range finders observe the battlefield,
estimate the range to any targets appearing in view, without
being specifically told to do so, communicate the range
found to the platoon commander (this should not be done by
shouting, as misunderstandings might result therefrom), and
observe the effect of the fire. (Par. 173 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>Whenever the flanks of a skirmish line are not protected
by other troops or by natural obstacles, a few men under a
prudent leader should always be sent out as combat patrols to
the flank, or better still, to the right or left front. The
patrol should under no circumstances lose connection with
the command which it is to protect, but, on the other hand,
should not stick so close to it that the file on the exposed
flank is in a position to see as much as the combat patrol
itself. As a report from a combat patrol frequently arrives
too late, or cannot be made at all on account of hostile fire,
signals should be agreed upon and the leader of the squad
on the exposed flank of the line should keep the combat
patrol constantly in view. Signal flags may also be employed
advantageously in such cases.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The <b>Austrian</b> deployment is similar to the German, the intervals between
skirmishers being about two paces. In <b>Italy</b> the skirmishers are
posted at intervals of 1.5 m. (<i>catena ordinaria</i>), but this interval may be
increased by order up to three paces (<i>catena rada</i>). The interval between
squads in extended order is 4-5 paces to facilitate volley fire by squad.
The <b>French</b> deployment is similar to the German. An intermediate
extended order formation is that in which an advance is made in line, the
files at extended intervals. In <b>England</b> skirmishers are placed at intervals
of 5-15 paces during the initial deployment. At short ranges where the
decision is sought, one rifle per 2-3 yards of front (1.8-2.7 m.) is the
rule, one rifle per yard of front (0.90 m.) being the maximum. In <b>Russia</b>
and <b>Japan</b> the intervals are as ordered. In <b>Switzerland</b> skirmishers are
posted at intervals of 1-2 paces; when a greater front is to be covered the
intervals between squads are increased. The length of the rushes depends
on the ground, the effect of fire, and the endurance of the men. In exceptional
cases an advance by rushes, by squads or single men, is authorized.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span></p>

<h5>(b) Movements in Skirmish Line.</h5>

<p>Fire action requires steady breathing, and, on this account,
all movements to the position at which the fire fight is to be
taken up, should be made, as long as possible, in a free
swinging stride. A careful observation of alignment or of
intervals cannot be insisted upon. Cover found within the
allotted front should be utilized by ploying, but this must
neither interfere with the harmonious advance of the entire
force nor cause a loss of the march direction. Considerations
of cover for individual men should not interfere with
the spontaneous progress of the movement. Orderly movements
in long skirmish lines are best made by designating
a certain element as the <i>base</i>, whose leader is far in advance
of it; all neighboring leaders maintain their intervals from,
and endeavor to remain approximately on line with him.
This has the advantage of relieving the commander of the
whole line from looking after these details and leaves him
free to concentrate all his attention on the enemy. Minor
changes of the march direction are executed by inclining
to the right or left or by designating a new objective. More
extended movements by the flank, within range of hostile
fire, are possible only under cover. Changes of direction are
executed like a gradual front into line, in which a temporary
echeloning of the elements, or one which can be adjusted
by degrees, is unavoidable. (Par. 185 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>In the absence of cover, an advance in quick time will
be possible only at long ranges unless the hostile fire can be
kept down by fire from enfilading or commanding positions.
Skirmish lines advancing without fire support over ground
devoid of cover, begin to suffer appreciable losses at 1000 m.
The more effective the hostile fire, the more pressing the
necessity of diminishing, as far as this is possible, the periods
of time during which the skirmishers present their whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
bodies as targets to the enemy. This leads in itself<a id="FNanchor88" href="#Footnote88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> to an
<b>advance by rushes</b>, since the whole distance separating
the advancing line from the enemy cannot be covered in one
rush. Double time may be employed by a skirmish line when
it becomes necessary to reinforce an advancing firing line
quickly, to forestall the enemy in reaching a certain point,
or in moving under fire, from the covered fire position occupied,
to another position. It is impossible to prescribe definitely
and for all cases at what ranges the advance by rushes
should be taken up and when fire should be opened in advancing
by rushes, since it depends upon the intensity of the
hostile fire.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote88" href="#FNanchor88" class="label">&#8199;[88]</a>
<span class="smcap">Kunz</span>, <cite>Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele</cite>, 14, pp. 40, 48 and 77.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The assailant will, in the first place, endeavor to advance
without firing, in order to reach those ranges quickly at which
his fire will begin to be effective against the well-covered
targets of the defender. The skirmishers advance in strong
detachments, by rushes of the greatest possible length, taking
short breathing spells at each halt. Very soon, however, the
hostile fire makes this advance impossible. A fire fight of
variable duration must first make a further advance possible
by silencing the fire of the defender. In a serious infantry
engagement every step forward must be purchased by the
fire of the attacking infantry. The attacker will, in exceptional
cases only, continue his advance in long lines, although
this must appear desirable to him, for almost invariably only
a part of his force will still be able to gain ground to the
front when supported by the fire of neighboring detachments.
Favorable local conditions, insignificant losses, and, above all,
the personality of the commander will embue a force with
the determination to advance.</p>

<h5>Time Required for Making a Rush. Strength of the
Force Making the Rush.</h5>

<p>The squad requires 5-6, the platoon at war strength

<p>While the attacker covers a distance of 80 m., the defender,
if in readiness, can fire 4-5 shots. This proves very
clearly that, in order to be able to make such a rush, a certain
superiority of fire is absolutely essential. These figures
change radically as soon as the troops are seriously engaged
with the enemy and come under his fire at short ranges. At
short ranges, aside from the size of the target offered, attempts
to advance by rushes with entire companies must
very soon cease of their own accord.</p>

<p>The character of the terrain and the fire of the enemy
play a decisive role here.</p>

<p>The strength of the force making the rush is intimately
connected with the length of the rushes. A small, isolated
force would run the risk of being fired on by its own
neighboring detachments. Besides, confidence and moral
courage are difficult to find in a small force. It is difficult
to carry forward long lines as units. The use of long lines
necessitates, as a rule, an almost complete cessation of fire,
and, in addition, mutual fire support suffers. Long lines
should therefore be employed only when the attacker possesses
a very marked superiority of fire. In practice it has
been found advantageous to make the rush with the smallest
fraction led by an officer, <i>i.e.</i>, with a platoon.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The following appropriate statement appears in <cite>Taktische Rückblicke
auf 1866</cite>: “In the danger zone which suddenly surrounds and startles
him in war, the soldier feels, in the first place, a desire to have someone<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
assure him that the seemingly critical situation in which he finds himself,
is as it should be. His eye is naturally directed upon his officers. If the
officer’s quiet glance reminds him that here, as in peace time, the first
duty is obedience, and if he sees the officer subsequently advance fearlessly
and vigorously, he will, as a rule, not worry about the why and wherefor.
It is this faithful attachment to the person of his officer, rather than
ambition and patriotism, which inspires the soldier to highest efforts.
Those who suppose that all our soldiers are heroes simply because they
are products of a courageous race, are very much mistaken. This would
indeed be an invincible army, requiring no tactical advice, if its soldiers
would do nothing in action but their simple duty voluntarily.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The severest test of discipline is for a skirmish line to
rise and rush forward under an effective hostile fire. This
movement had best be executed with precision and energy
even during peace exercises. The formation and manner of
execution must become second nature to the soldier, like a
movement of the manual of arms, which he retains during
his entire military service, and a knowledge of which he
brings with him when called to the colors during mobilization.
The example set by advancing leaders and the arrival
of reinforcements, which move forward through the firing
line, have been found to be the most effective means of
carrying a skirmish line forward.</p>

<p>The critical moment occurs when the men rise and
prepare to rush forward, for an unsubdued enemy will be
desirous to prevent, by increasing his fire, any attempt
to advance. The fire support afforded by neighboring detachments
would seem to have a conditional value only; for,
being themselves under fire, the skirmishers of these detachments
cannot be expected to divert their fire from the opponent
previously fired upon, to an enemy by whom they themselves
are not threatened. In oblique fire, the rifles, on
account of their short barrel, interfere with neighboring
ones, and, in addition, expose the men advancing on the flanks
to the danger of being hit by the fire of their comrades. The
fire support is, therefore, restricted to hindering the hostile
skirmishers directly opposite from firing on the advancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
unit. When the terrain is favorable, infantry and machine
guns should not hesitate to fire over the heads of their own
skirmishers. The coöperation of artillery will, in any case,
be of great value, and infantry will have to select those
moments for advancing when the defender is driven under
cover by the hail of shot.</p>

<p>The advance by rushes, consuming time and energy,
is an expedient to which the enemy compels us to
resort as the only means of gaining ground to the front.
The firm determination to close with the enemy and the ever-increasing
difficulty of inducing the men to advance from
cover, require that long rushes be made. Short rushes
are neither consonant with the nature of the attack, nor with
the desire to close with the enemy. “Many halts during an
advance are fatal to the offensive.” (<span class="smcap">Hönig</span>). The
powers of endurance of the men, the character of the
ground, and the hostile fire, as well as the support afforded
by infantry and artillery fire, influence the length of the rush.
If the leader has already caused the skirmishers to rise, it
is best to let them run forward so long as the physical powers
of the men and the hostile fire permit. The only danger is
that the men will throw themselves down prematurely, and
without orders. It is rather an advantage that during the
rapid advance, increasing both muscular and nervous activity,
the men do not think of danger and have no time to pay
attention to their fallen comrades. One fact is, however,
worthy of special attention: If we train a soldier to make
long rushes in time of peace, he will be able to make them
in time of war, and it is easier for a leader to decrease than
to increase the length of rushes in the field.</p>

<p>The short rushes are considered advantageous because
they take the enemy by surprise, in consequence of which he
is not in a condition to direct his fire on the advancing unit.
Rushes should be made with startling suddenness. They should<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
not be made in step at double time, but, on the contrary, as
rapidly as possible (by rushing); by the time the enemy directs
his fire on them, the skirmishers should already have thrown
themselves down. Stragglers should also throw themselves
down, when the men in the lead drop down behind cover, and
should then endeavor to reach the firing line by crawling.</p>

<p>The enemy will concentrate his fire on the unit which
advanced first. The fire of this unit will at the start
be rather weak, getting stronger gradually. If this unit is
left in its advanced position for some time there is danger
of its being thrown back; all neighboring units must therefore
endeavor to rejoin it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The greater the superiority of our fire, <i>i.e.</i>, the marksmanship
which compels the enemy to keep under cover, the
greater the length of the rushes and the rapidity with which
they follow upon each other.</p>

<p>Short rushes with small units occur quite naturally, because
the platoon leader no longer succeeds in inducing his
whole platoon to rise, since his influence extends only to the
men nearest him, and because the flank squads at first remain
behind and only gradually try to rejoin the leading skirmishers.
If only a part of the skirmishers have jumped up, it is
quite natural for them not to make a long rush, but to throw
themselves down before reaching the new position, because
of the feeling that they have been abandoned by their comrades
and the fear of running into their field of fire. Thus,
in spite of the best intentions of the leader, the short rush
by small units occurs. In time of peace, however, we should
retain the long rush by platoons and not endeavor to give
human weaknesses the force of regulations.</p>

<p>When once compelled to employ short rushes the following
question presents itself: Is the advantage of such a
small gain of ground worth the trouble of inducing the
soldier to rise for making an advance by rushes? Would it,
therefore, not be more profitable to <b>crawl forward</b>? A man<span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span>
crawling on his belly presents a vulnerable surface of approximately
the size of a breast plate 50 cm. high. In an advance
made by a large unit, or over covered terrain (fields of
standing grain) crawling would be difficult (difficulty of
maintaining the direction of march and reduction of the rate
of advance); it would also be difficult to get men to advance
to the charge after they have crawled along in this fashion
for some time. The supervision of a unit crawling forward
would also be exceedingly difficult. The following results
were obtained in experiments made under favorable conditions:
A distance of 500 m. was covered by crawling in
about 10 minutes; crawling tired the men, increased the
activity of the lungs to such an extent that deliberate aiming
and firing was out of the question and the motion produced
a noticeable swelling of arms, hands and knees.<a id="FNanchor89" href="#Footnote89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The Boers
occasionally used the following method: One man crept
forward once or twice his own length, raising his body
slightly, while the man next to him fired; then they exchanged
roles and this procedure was repeated uninterruptedly.
In any case, troops ought to be able to execute both
the advance by rushes and the advance by crawling with or
without firing. On terrain devoid of cover a skirmish line
will frequently be able to advance only by crawling.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote89" href="#FNanchor89" class="label">&#8199;[89]</a> During the engagement at Paardeberg (18th February, 1900), the fighting
line of the British 9th Infantry Division was reinforced by troops crawling up
into the line, and carried forward to within 450 m. of the enemy’s position. An
isolated assault was subsequently repulsed by the Boers.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>Procedure: The man throws himself on the ground at full length,
head resting upon the bent left arm, right hand grasping the small of
the rifle-stock. The man moves forward by alternately bending and
straightening the right leg. When the right leg is straightened the body
slides forward without rising in the least from the ground, and the head
also remains in position resting on the left arm. The head is raised only
when the man fires his piece, the butt of which is placed against the
shoulder. Crawling on all fours is very tiring, the man offers a larger
target, and, in addition, is not immediately ready for firing.</p>

<p>In this manner the Boers succeeded in shooting the enemy out of his
position. The firing line, while keeping up an incessant fire, slowly
but steadily advanced. The advance of this uncanny crawling line is said<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
to have produced an especially disquieting and paralyzing impression on
the immovable defender, who was tied to his position, because of his
inability to inflict perceptible losses on these small, prone targets, and
because, moreover, he himself was continually under a galling fire. As
no assault was made, no opportunity was offered the defender for using
his rifles against targets the height of a man. The British infantrymen
were, however, insufficiently trained in handling their weapons independently.
As to rise and to retreat meant annihilation, the determination to
resist weakened gradually during the long fire fight, and, in order to escape
from this seemingly unendurable situation, which grew more and more
acute with every minute, and which paralyzed every energetic decision,
one avenue of escape only seemed open, that of surrender.<a id="FNanchor90" href="#Footnote90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>One who fought on the Boer side writes as follows: “After we
had crept up, in this manner, constantly firing and crawling, to within
about 300 m. of the enemy, we saw many white handkerchiefs waving
over in his lines, as a signal of surrender. As we placed little credence in
these signs of surrender, however, on account of many a bad experience,
we continued the advance by crawling. But, as soon as we saw that
most of the men in the enemy’s ranks were throwing away their weapons,
we rose to make the British prisoners. When we came up with them, I
noticed that a great many of the men were weeping like children. Later,
when I voiced my astonishment over the morale of their troops to some
English officers, they stated that it was due to the uncanny manner of our
advance.</p>

<p>“These officers stated, moreover, that the sight of danger approaching
ever closer without their being able to ward it off effectively, caused great
depression and alarm among their troops; for the Boers, utilizing every
available rock in crawling over the plain, presented such an unfavorable
target that the British fire had had very little effect, while they themselves
had been constantly exposed to the Boer fire. All this, they
claimed, had contributed to unnerve their troops.”<a id="FNanchor91" href="#Footnote91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p class="hinline nospace">: “The rushes *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
were of variable length, according to the intensity of the
hostile fire; they varied from 30 to 80 m. According to the
opinion of many British officers it was exceedingly difficult
to induce skirmishers to rise and rush forward under hostile
fire; but that once upon their feet, it became necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
push the attack forward as far as possible regardless of the
increased losses entailed by the longer rushes.”<a id="FNanchor92" href="#Footnote92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>One who fought on the Boer side reports as follows in
regard to the British advance by rushes: “The men rose
gradually and hesitatingly. This gave the attentively watching
enemy time to pour a well directed fire upon the last men
who arose. Thus even short rushes made by long lines became
generally too costly to be executed. Smaller groups,
on the other hand, were able to move with startling rapidity.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Every sudden interruption of the firing that
might attract the enemy’s attention should therefore be carefully
avoided, but, as a rule, this is possible only when the
advancing units are small.”</p>

<p>The British Regulations of 1896 prescribe rushes of
30-40 m., and those published immediately after the war
(1902) prescribe rushes of 70-90 m., but the rush is to continue
only while the surprise of the enemy lasts.</p>

<h5>Russo-Japanese War.</h5>

<p>In the Japanese army, the 5th Infantry Division employed
short, and very short, rushes by preference, while
other divisions of the 1st Army as a rule preferred long
rushes. From an English work we obtain the following
data in regard to the length of rushes and the expenditure
of ammunition per rifle during halts between consecutive
rushes in the engagement on the Shiliho on October 12th,
1904, at ranges beginning with 1,000 m.</p>

<p>From the table it appears that after gaining the superiority
of fire, beginning with the fifth rush, at about 625
m. from the enemy, the length of the rushes increased; the
last 400 m. were covered in one rush as the enemy withdrew
from his position.</p>

<h5>Provisions of the Various Regulations Relative to the
Advance by Rushes.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>Germany.</b> (Pars. 188, 189 and 337 I. D. R.). To advance by
rushes, the following commands are given: (Such) <b>Platoon (section,
squad) Rush!... Rise!... March! March!</b> At the command
<b>Rush!</b> the skirmishers finish loading, lock pieces, close cartridge boxes,
and prepare to rise. Skirmishers lying prone take the piece in the left
hand, lean on the right, and draw the right knee as close to the body as
possible without thereby raising the body from the ground. After a brief
pause, during which these preparations are made, the platoon commander
jumps up and at the same time commands: <b>Rise!... March! March!</b>
At this command the skirmishers jump up and rush forward. The
length of the rush will rarely exceed 80 m. (Par. 337 German I. D. R.).
While rushes should, as a rule, be as long as possible, short rushes, which
are designed to leave the enemy no time for firing, should also be
practiced. The principal thing is that skirmishers rise promptly and
simultaneously and that they rush forward rapidly. The rush is terminated
by the command “<i>Position</i>”; the sight setting is changed when necessary
and fire opened without further preliminaries. Frequently the new firing
position may be indicated before the rush is made.</p>

<p><b>Austria.</b> Rushes are as a rule made by platoons. “The length of
the rushes depends upon the character of the ground and the tactical situation,
as well as upon the physical condition of the men. They serve as
an expedient for reaching the next firing position.”</p>

<p><b>France.</b> Rushes are made, without fixed rules, from cover to cover
(<i>par bonds successifs</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span></p>

<p><b>England.</b> (Regulations dated 1896): Originally the regulations prescribed
rushes 30-40 m. long, but, as a matter of fact, their length was
actually increased to 60 and 100 m. during the first engagements of the
South African war, in cases where the fire of the enemy was not
especially heavy. The regulations of 1905, recently published, state:
“Rushes over open ground should not exceed 80-100 yards (<i>i.e.</i>, 70-90
m.) and will, in fact, rarely reach this length. At decisive ranges,
<i>i.e.</i>, under 540 m., they should be short enough to afford the enemy no
opportunity to pour a well-directed fire on the skirmishers. When cover
is available the advance is made from cover to cover.” At another place
the regulations state: “On open ground and within effective range, long
lines of skirmishers, rising simultaneously, will suffer heavy losses even
when making short rushes; the sudden movement of smaller units may
take the enemy unawares, so that for a time at least well aimed fire is
avoided. The rush is continued only while the surprise of the enemy
lasts. The shorter the range, the smaller the advancing units will have
to be, and the shorter the length of the rushes.”</p>

<p>All preparations for a rush must be made as unostentatiously as
possible. The units following in rear should, whenever possible, advance
beyond the leading unit which is lying down and firing. When an advance
by rushes in units is impossible, individuals may run or crawl forward.</p>

<p><b>Italy.</b> Long rushes, at least with platoons, otherwise with companies,
are used as a rule, so long as the hostile fire permits. When the intensity
of the hostile fire increases, or after the organizations have become mixed,
rushes can no longer be made by entire units but only by squads or like
fractions. These leave the main line and endeavor to reach the next cover
at a rapid run, or if cover be lacking, throw themselves down in order to
open fire again at the shorter range thus gained. As a rule, the leading
echelons open fire at once from their new positions so as to facilitate the
advance of the others, unless special circumstances make it advisable to
delay the firing until all the other units have reached a good position and
are able to direct an effective fire upon the enemy.</p>

<p><b>Japan.</b> Rushes are made according to German pattern, their maximum
length being 100, their minimum 30-40 m. Rushes are not made by
units smaller than a platoon.</p>

<p><b>Russia.</b> Rushes are made by individual men, by groups, by sections,
and by platoons. The length of the rushes is not indicated. When sections
advance by rushes the platoon commander indicates the section which is to
advance first, and also the order in which the others are to follow. The
Russian regulations are the only ones which prescribe a “movement to the
rear by rushes,” at a run.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>Frequently, when the men are very much fatigued, when
advancing over plowed ground and through extensive grain
fields, an advance by rushes will be impossible. Whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
<b>fire while in motion</b> ought to be employed in this case
should be determined. A preliminary condition for its employment
is, however, that the enemy’s fire has been subdued
or that he has been forced under cover. To advance
against an unshaken enemy with fire while in motion must
lead to the annihilation of the attacking force. While the
defender scores only 12.8% hits against advancing skirmishers
at 700 m., the attacker scores only 1.6% to 3.5% hits
against head and breast targets. With such a discrepancy
in fire effect, the attack, if employing fire while in motion,
is bound to collapse, unless it has already gained a superiority
of fire prior to the advance. It is unfortunate that fire
while in motion is frequently employed when inappropriate
during drills. The danger of men wounding each other and
of the advance hesitating because the officers are not in front
of the line is not to be underestimated. On the other hand,
the advantages of eliminating the difficulties of inducing the
men to rise, of the troops leaving their losses behind, of
stragglers being more easily detected, and of keeping the
entire hostile line under fire, cannot be denied. In war this
method of advance will frequently result without orders
while advancing to the charge after the defender has been
driven under cover. (In Russia this mode of advance is prescribed).</p>

<p>During experiments in field firing, held in Austria by a force advancing
from 1,400 to 600 paces, with an expenditure of an equal number of
rounds of ammunition in each experiment, the following results were obtained:</p>

<p>There is no model advance within the zone of effective
infantry fire. All expedients, whether they be sneaking or
crawling, long or short rushes, or fire while in motion, are of
equal value, if the force, kept well in hand by the leader, is
thereby brought closer to the enemy. Every opportunity to
gain a foot of ground to the front, offered by flanking fire
or fire directed at the enemy over the heads of the advancing
force, must be utilized. The effect of our own artillery fire
should also be attentively followed with a view to advancing
when the hostile skirmishers have sought refuge under cover
to escape our shrapnel.</p>

<p>Two battalions of the <i>Kaiser Franz</i> Guard Grenadier Regiment had to
advance from Dugny against the enemy in the northwest edge of Le
Bourget over 1,500 m. of very open terrain, covered only with high potato<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
crops. The battalions were formed in two lines with two companies entirely
deployed in the first line, and the battalion reserves in rear of the center
of the line with files at extended intervals. The second line was formed
similarly. The two companies in the firing line advanced at first without
firing, by rushes of about 300 m. each, made by alternate companies, each
moving forward beyond the point where the other had halted. When
effective range was reached one company opened rapid fire while the other
moved forward by long rushes. The companies in rear followed in a
similar manner. The tall potato bushes partly concealed the lines while
lying down. In this manner the two battalions reached the outskirts of the
village almost without being checked, the defender having withdrawn to
the interior of the village.</p>

<p>The losses of the two battalions, while advancing by rushes, were
insignificant.</p>

<p>The regimental commander, bearing in mind the lessons gained at St.
Privat, had drilled the regiment beforehand in this mode of attack.</p>

<p>2. Attack on Redout No. 2, at <b>Scheinovo</b>, on January 9th, 1878.</p>

<p>The attack by Skobeleff’s Division, consisting of four battalions (<i>Drushines</i>)
of Bulgarians, and the <i>Ugla</i>,
<i>Vladimir</i>, and <i>Kasan</i> Regiments, was
to be made under cover of the fire of two rifle battalions armed with
Berdan rifles, and of a provisional battalion of the <i>Ugla</i> Regiment armed
with captured Turkish rifles. The only artillery available consisted of
a mountain battery, while the Turks were able to bring twenty guns into
action.</p>

<p>The Turkish rifle fire began at about 1,000-1,200 m., but the Russian
firing lines continued the advance with shouldered arms. Only when the
losses increased noticeably did they advance by rushes, <i>without firing</i>, from
750 to about 500 m. where they opened fire. The rushes were made by the
entire firing line; the supports, with files at extended intervals, did not
follow until the firing line had thrown itself down.</p>

<p>After the firing had lasted for some time, the Ugla Regiment, from the
reserve, was formed in three lines, each consisting of one battalion, each
battalion again into two lines with 350 m. distance between lines (total
depth of the column about 1,800 m.). From 900 m. on, the advance was
made by rushes, the entire force inclining to the right front. While
covered by the fire of the skirmishers of the firing line in front, the length
of the rushes was 100-150 m. At 250 m. from the enemy, the leading
line, extending the line of the Bulgarian and Rifle Battalions, was able
to open fire and, after about thirty minutes, when it was clearly apparent
that the Turks were evacuating the work, the regiment began the assault,
which was successful.</p>

<p>Of the troops in the first line, the 11th Rifle Battalion lost 11 officers
and 422 men; the 9th Rifle Battalion, 5 officers and 269 men; the original
strength of each being about 800 men. Expenditure of ammunition: 11th

<p>The Ugla Regiment, which advanced in close order after the defender’s
fire had been silenced, lost only nine officers and 391 men. The Kasan
Regiment, which followed the Ugla Regiment, participated in the assault
on the second Turkish position. The Turkish fire had abated to such an
extent that the battalions were able to advance in rear of one another, each
in two lines with distances of only 35 m. between lines; the intervals between
companies were 15 m., and those between files were extended.
Losses: four officers and 76 men. Expenditure of ammunition: 12 rounds

<p>In contrast with these examples of long rushes, almost
every obstinate engagement with an unshaken enemy showed
that “every step forward” had to be literally gained by the
impulse imparted by the arrival of small, fresh detachments,
that the rushes often faltered after only 20-30 paces, and
that frequently nothing remained but to work forward individually.

<h5>(c) Reinforcing the Firing Line.</h5>

<p>If the fire power of the firing line is to be maintained
after heavy losses, or the intensity of its fire is to be augmented,
or when it finally is to receive the impulse for making
a further advance, it must be reinforced. (Pars. 226, 227
and 341 German I. D. R.). This may be done by prolonging
the line (platoons abreast at well defined intervals), or, when
space is lacking and after losses have occurred, by putting
men in the intervals (<i>i.e.</i>, increasing the density of the line
and filling it up). When the firing line is prolonged, tactical
units are not broken up, and this facilitates fire control.
Whenever practicable, the firing line should be reinforced
by prolonging it, although the other method, that of placing
men in the intervals and gaps of the firing line, is more frequently
used and more practical because the arrival of fresh
men and the replacement of incapacitated officers occasioned
thereby renews the strength of the firing line (replenishment
of ammunition). The breaking up of platoons is unavoidable,
and on that account platoon and squad leaders
should be trained in time of peace to form new units at
once so that control is not lost. In order to prevent the mixing
of units, so far as this is possible, and to keep the firing
line filled up with skirmishers, even during an engagement entailing
heavy losses, it is indispensable that the fighting front
should be limited, that of a company in attack to 150, in defense
to about 200 m. The unit designated to reinforce the
firing line endeavors to approach that line under cover,
forms skirmish line at any rate before leaving the last cover
and advances by rushes, or, if directly in rear of the firing
line and under a heavy fire, even by crawling.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>Austria.</b> Both modes of reinforcing the firing line, that of prolonging
it, and that of filling the intervals and gaps, are used. When prolonging
the line the reinforcement may remain abreast of the firing line. During
an attack efforts should, however, be made to advance beyond the firing
line&mdash;“to overreach it.” The other method, that of filling up the line, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
in attack, as a rule, to be used for the purpose of carrying the line forward,
the rush to be made as soon as the reinforcement reaches the firing
line. Signals are prescribed for prolonging the line without advancing
beyond it, for reinforcing that line and advancing beyond it, and for
filling it up and carrying it forward in a rush.</p>

<h5>(d) Closing Up. Assembling. Re-Forming.<br />
<span class="nonbold">(Pars. 211-214 and 230-232 German I. D. R.).</span></h5>

<p>The most effective method of preventing a mixing of
organizations in action is for all units constantly to endeavor
to close in toward their leaders, filling gaps as soon as casualties
have occurred. Squads which have sustained heavy
losses unite with adjoining ones under a common leader.
This closing in can, as a rule, be executed only while in
motion. It must be effected gradually and the intervals
ordered should be maintained. Crowding of every description
increases losses and causes dangerous gaps along the
entire front.</p>

<p>If in the course of an engagement, the purpose of the
action and the situation make it no longer desirable to retain
an extended order formation, each leader, from the
squad leader upward, must assemble his unit at once and
place himself and it at the disposal of the commander of
the next higher unit. Formed bodies must be created quickly
and held well in hand by their leaders, without awaiting specific
orders to that effect.</p>

<p>The troops must be assembled very quietly and always
facing the enemy.</p>

<p>The original organizations are not re-formed until the
command “Fall in” is given. (Pars. 214 and 232 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span></p>

<h4>10. SUPPORTS.<br />
<span class="nonbold">(Pars. 222-228 and 341 German I. D. R.).</span></h4>

<p>The limited front assigned to an organization necessitates,
in the first place, a division into firing line and retained
fractions. At the decisive stage of a fight every available man
must, without question, be in the first line.</p>

<p>Italy. Supports are not to be used when they cannot
be maintained at a less distance from the firing line than that
separating the latter from the enemy.</p>

<p>It is the duty of supports to reinforce and extend the
firing line, to cover the flanks (par. 222 German I. D. R.),
to act as a reserve, and, in case of necessity, as a rallying force
upon which the firing line can fall back. The presence of
supports increases confidence in attack, and the power of
resistance in defense. Supports enable a leader to influence
the action, to give a firing line that has been checked
the impetus necessary to carry it forward, and to affect the
action by sending reinforcements to points where he wishes
to gain an advantage. The support follows that part of the
firing line which, in all probability, will need its assistance;
if part of the same organization as the firing line, it follows
in rear of the center, otherwise in rear of a wing. In a company
advancing alone over covered terrain, it will sometimes
be necessary to place small supports in rear of both flanks.
Firing lines can perhaps advance for some time under hostile
fire, whether they move by twos, by squads, or by
platoons, but the power necessary for pushing home the attack
must be imparted to them from the rear; otherwise the
energy of the attack will spend itself. The necessity of
having supports in rear of the firing line is clearly illustrated
in the very instructive engagement at Wagon Hill in
front of Ladysmith (6th January 1900). In this fight all
attempts to push the firing line forward failed, and the necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
impetus for the decisive advance was not given until
fresh supports were fed into the firing line.<a id="FNanchor100" href="#Footnote100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote100" href="#FNanchor100" class="label">[100]</a> <cite>The Times History of the War in South Africa</cite>, III, p. 200.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In hilly country the supports can fire over the heads of
the skirmishers in front of them without neglecting their
proper functions. (Switzerland and England). Such opportunities
should not be overlooked, as they increase the volume
of fire.</p>

<p>Distances depend upon the object to be attained by the
action and upon the terrain.</p>

<p>When a decision is sought, distances should be decreased
in the course of the action. When this is the case, the leaders
of all grades should be animated by but one desire, that
of being in front in order to participate in gaining the victory.
The duration of the crisis of an action is usually
brief, and in a very few rapidly passing moments the leader
must decide what to do with the troops remaining available.</p>

<p>When an immediate decision is not sought, it is advisable
to increase distances in order to keep the echelons held back in
rear from coming under fire. In any case, the distance between
supports and firing line should be less than the distance
between firing line and enemy. In an attack, supports
should be close enough to the firing line to prevent, by timely
interference, a retrograde movement of the latter. On the
defensive, on account of the difficulty of bringing up supports
for the purpose of repulsing an assault, they will
usually be placed a short distance immediately in rear of or
within the firing line (intrenched) at the points where they
are to be employed.</p>

<p>During an attack, whenever the lines in rear cannot be
kept out of hostile fire, care must nevertheless be taken that
two echelons be not simultaneously struck by a cone of infantry
fire or by one and the same shrapnel. The distance
between echelons is therefore increased to more than 300<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
m., and should not be reduced until the decisive stage of the
combat approaches.</p>

<p>In open country, supports held too close to the firing line
will soon cease to exist as such. When kept in close order, their
losses would be so great that the boldest men would join the
firing line and the less courageous would hunt cover. Everything
depends upon the manner in which supports are led
forward, especially during that part of the advance immediately
preceding their junction with the firing line. In this
lies the whole art of fighting in deep formations. Covered
terrain permits distances to be reduced. The commander
should be particularly careful not to let this advantage escape
him, since on such terrain it is more frequently necessary
promptly to reinforce the firing line.</p>

<p>The commander of the support must constantly observe
the movements and successes of the firing line in order that
he may be able to reinforce it in the most advantageous manner.
Whenever he is obliged to split up his command during
a movement to the front, he should endeavor to reunite
it at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>The support should closely adapt its movements to those
of the firing line. When a part of the firing line makes a
rush, the support halts for the moment, and then runs forward
to the next cover, simultaneously with the next advancing
unit of the firing line, and covered by the fire of the
skirmishers in front. “To make a rush at the same time as
the firing line was impossible, because, as soon as the latter
rose, the Turks opened a murderous fire. Whenever the
firing line threw itself down and returned the fire, that of
the enemy became noticeably weaker.”<a id="FNanchor101" href="#Footnote101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>The supports follow the firing line in single or double
rank, in column of twos or squads, in skirmish line or in
line of squads, in quick time or by rushes; it may also be
advisable to deviate temporarily from the direction of advance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
Columns having a narrow front, so long as they
are not open to attack from a flank, are able to withstand
long range infantry fire. (Par. 224 German I. D. R.).
On coming to a halt, it is advisable to return to close order
formation; at any rate, the leader must get his command
again entirely under control.</p>

<h5>Supports in Rear of the Firing Line or Not?</h5>

<p>Up to a few years ago (1894), the French battalion
was divided into firing line and companies of the second line.
The Japanese, also, often placed entire companies in the
firing line, which could not be quickly enough reinforced by
the companies of the second line, because these were held
too far in rear. At any rate, supports are of advantage during
the first deployment before the situation is clear.</p>

<p>The following arguments are advanced against the employment
of supports:</p>

<p>1. <i>The supports following the firing line suffer losses,
without, as a rule, being able to participate in the action.</i>
This argument is not well founded, since the criticism made
with reference to supports is equally applicable to companies
in the second line. That supports threw themselves into the
firing line in the Franco-German war, in the belief that they
were needlessly suffering losses, was due to the fact that
they followed the firing line too closely.</p>

<p>Supports following the firing line closely (250-300 m.)
can reach the firing line quickly and can easily find cover
on account of the small angle of fall of modern bullets.
Besides, the knowledge that supports are immediately in rear,
the moral factor, should not be underestimated.</p>

<p>2. <i>The supports may be commanded by inexperienced
leaders, who will not always act with the good judgment the
situation demands and will fail to seize the right moment
for advancing.</i> (This can perhaps never be avoided).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span></p>

<p>3. <i>Pushing the supports into the firing line tends to
mix units, makes control more difficult, and impairs the
efficacy of fire.</i> These criticisms are not applicable to a
company, for it is in any case impossible for the company
commander to control the fire; this is the business of platoon
commanders.</p>

<p>The advantages of supports are, that they increase the
number of targets offered the hostile artillery; that, by reason
of their small size, they can utilize every accident of
the ground; that they can be kept close enough to the firing
line to reinforce it in case of sudden emergency; and that
they allow companies in the second line to be kept farther
to the rear. A battalion, when part of a larger force, need
not keep formed bodies as supports; but a few platoons, following
the firing line in close order on the flanks, are an advantage.
The drawbacks of the <i>petits paquets</i> would appear
only if every company were to preserve a support up to the
decisive stage of the action.</p>

<h4>11. COMPARISON BETWEEN CLOSE AND EXTENDED
ORDER.</h4>

<p>In <b>close order</b> the men are placed so close together that
they can be led by word of command and directly influenced
by their officers. The position of the individual soldier is
fixed; the men on either side of him interfere with his utilizing
cover or his weapon. On terrain devoid of cover, close
order formations present such large targets to infantry fire,
that their employment, when exposed to the unsubdued fire
of the enemy, is impossible and must lead to annihilation.
Thus the hostile fire compels the most extended deployment.<a id="FNanchor102" href="#Footnote102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote102" href="#FNanchor102" class="label">[102]</a> Even during the Franco-German war it was impossible to employ close
order formations in the first line, when opposed by an unshaken enemy, although
this was still prescribed by the regulations. Whenever this was attempted tremendous
losses resulted. In the battle of Vionville the 5th and 8th Companies
of the 35th Füsilier-Regiment, formed into a half-battalion, and following the
other companies of the battalion, which were pushed forward as the first line,
suffered in five minutes a loss of 9 officers and 150 men (out of a total of about
400 men) from infantry fire at 1000 to 1200 m. “The impression produced was
so overpowering that the commands for extending and deploying could not be
executed at all and that the half-battalion had to be withdrawn in rear of the
cemetery where it was assembled by the three officers still remaining.” <cite>Geschichte
des Regiments Nr. 35</cite>, p. 23.</p>

<p>In cases where troops appeared in close order each losses were not at all
exceptional.</p>

<p>On August 18th, 1870, the Füsilier-Battalion of the 85th Infantry, advancing
from Vernéville, at first in double column, then in half-battalion column, to
within 400 paces of the enemy, lost 12 officers, 32 non-commissioned officers, and
437 men killed and wounded (52%) in 20 minutes by the cross-fire of hostile
artillery and mitrailleuse batteries. At 800 paces from the enemy the fragments
of the battalion were assembled in three platoons. <cite>Gen. St. W.</cite>, II, p. 724.
<cite>Der 18. August</cite>, p. 152.</p>

<p>The success of the bayonet attack made by the 9th Company of the 29th
Infantry at St. Quentin may be explained by the inferiority of the opponent.
<cite>Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 29</cite>, p. 499.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span></p>

<p>In <b>extended order</b> the soldier’s position is not definitely
fixed; he is not required to keep his body in a prescribed
position, nor is he expected to handle his rifle by the numbers
as in the manual. Instead, judgment, agility, courage,
confidence in himself, skill in handling his weapon and in
taking full advantage of the accidents of the ground, as well
as unremitting attention to his leader, are demanded of the
skirmisher.</p>

<p>The difficulties of troop leading are, moreover, increased
by the noise and other disorganizing influences of
the fight, especially in broken or wooded country. Whether
an organization is thoroughly trained and disciplined is best
shown in extended order fighting, for, as the direct control
of the leader on his command decreases, the demands made
on the initiative of the individual soldier increase out of all
proportion. It is at any rate more practical to develop this
initiative than to try to prevent the disorganizing effect of
combat by restricting the personal freedom of the individual
soldier.</p>

<p>In order to keep troops well in hand and to deploy
them quickly in any direction, it is requisite that close order
formations be retained as long as the terrain and the hostile
fire permit. After an action, in order to make a renewed
employment of the troops possible, they must be assembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
in close order without regard to the previously existing organization.</p>

<p>In night combats, in actions against cavalry not supported
by other arms, in putting down rebellions, and frequently
in colonial wars<a id="FNanchor103" href="#Footnote103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> as well, the importance of close
order formations increases when the troops show a disposition
to get out of hand.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote103" href="#FNanchor103" class="label">[103]</a>
The British <i>Infantry Training</i> contains special regulations governing “savage
warfare,” in which close order battalion formations are explicitly given the
preference (order in echelon, square).</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In extended order, infantry can most easily surmount
obstacles, cross difficult terrain, and take the fullest advantage
of the accidents of the ground, as cover against hostile
fire and as rifle rests. In extended order, infantry is, moreover,
able to develop its fire power most effectively, while
at the same time offering the smallest possible targets to the
hostile projectiles. Thus the <i>skirmish line</i> is the principal
combat formation of infantry; by means of it a combat is
initiated and carried through to the end.</p>

<p>Close order is best adapted for establishing discipline
in the simplest and most rapid manner by means of drill.
At Jena the Prussian battalions were not defeated because
of their drill, but because they were poorly led. What function
drill had fulfilled at that time is pretty well illustrated
by the heavy losses sustained by the Prussian infantry and
by the fact that, although placed in a situation to which
they were entirely unaccustomed, the troops retained their
steadiness. No properly led army has been able to dispense
with drill in developing its discipline. In the days of linear
and column tactics the ultimate object of training was the
leading of battalions in close order, in magnificent array,
against the enemy. By means of drill a passive discipline
was to be created in which intelligence played no part whatever.
We know with what energy the army of the First
Napoleon was drilled according to the wholly superannuated
regulations of linear tactics in the camp at Boulogne and<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
during the brief pauses between campaigns. A well drilled
organization has ever, when well led, proved equal to the
occasion.<a id="FNanchor104" href="#Footnote104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> The electrifying word of command is an important
factor in assisting an organization accustomed to it to
overcome difficult situations. No leader will voluntarily dispense
with this aid. When Austrian shells struck the company
of Count Finkenstein during the advance against the
Shipwald, that officer halted his command, brought it to
shoulder arms and did not continue the movement until order
had been completely restored.</p>

<cite>Der 18. August</cite>, p. 463, in regard to the importance of
discipline in the execution of the attack on St. Privat.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>General v. Blume considers drill and skirmish training
two distinct methods by means of which efficient soldiers
may be created. To quote: “In this connection the most
perfect results would undoubtedly be attained by efficient
drill and thorough skirmish training.” Where both these
methods cannot be coördinated, training in extended order
fighting should take precedence. General v. d. Goltz raises
the objection that this might perhaps produce skirmishers,
but not soldiers, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>men whose devotion to duty surpasses
their fear of death</i>. General v. d. Goltz is right in demanding
combat drill. In this term he includes the painstaking
execution of all those accomplishments which the
skirmisher needs in action and which he should be able to
use correctly and quickly without lengthy deliberation. To
this category belong rapid loading and setting of the sight,
good pointing in any position, accurate aiming, cool firing,
quick locking of the piece, prompt jumping up for the advance,
taking advantage of accidents of the ground in lying
down for the purpose of heightening the fire effect, crawling
forward with or without firing, etc., etc. Since all these
things must be practiced individually, and since many of
them do not permit of simultaneous execution by an entire
unit, we usually speak of combat training instead of combat
drill, without, however, intending any other meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span></p>

<p>“Drill is always mechanical. The instructor can make
the skirmisher load quickly and carefully, can cause him to
take the position of aim, just as he drills the correct execution
of present arms and the rise preparatory to advancing
by rushes. Training is directed at the mentality of the man,
it makes him independent and allows him to exercise initiative,
even when he is no longer directly under his superior
officers’ influence, and when, in a critical hour, he is no
longer able to follow their example.</p>

<p>“Drill and training are both justified, each in its appropriate
sphere; the scope of both is closely defined and
neither one could be dispensed with. ‘Drill’ assists in creating
the ‘soldier,’ because it develops the characteristics which
must be required of a ‘soldier’: Endurance in surmounting
hardships and dangers, unquestioning subordination of his
will to that of the leader, tenacity and trustworthiness, skill
in handling his weapon and in utilizing the ground. The
addition of training will, of course, increase the value of this
‘soldier’ very considerably.</p>

<p>“Training alone will never attain this object. To
arouse and develop the man’s intellect may make him a good
skirmisher, a skillful member of a patrol, but for battle he
remains incomplete, since his awakened mental powers have
not been made available by the disciplining drill. His energies
are not governed by a higher will. Nothing can give
us the assurance that he may not fail at the most decisive
moment. He is no soldier.”<a id="FNanchor105" href="#Footnote105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The French, for reasons inherent in their character, discard
this drill and seek to replace it by developing the moral
factors: “Moral powers are the mightiest pillars of success.

The spirit of self-sacrifice and the determination to win ensure

pitch. ‘Victory or death’ is the watchword when marching out&mdash;but neither
is quickly attainable; weeks and months of the severest hardships, exhausting
marches, wet and hungry bivouacs must first be endured. Very soon
the intoxication of enthusiasm is gone and reality weighs heavily on the
sobered men. Finally the enemy is confronted. But he is not to be
annihilated at once by a rapid assault&mdash;not at all; the advance is made very
slowly and the highest enthusiasm is given ample time to evaporate during
the many hours in which death is constantly faced.” <span class="smcap">Layman.</span></p>

<p>For enthusiasm, we would substitute faithful, unselfish
performance of duty, and unquestioning subordination of the
will of the individual to that of the leader. To be sure, on
days of success enthusiasm will suffice, but not when everything
around us begins to waver and to yield. The importance
of drill, which cannot be replaced by anything else, does
not become apparent until all enthusiasm disappears, until
the leader becomes conscious of the specter of panic which
stalks by the side of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Discipline,” says Archduke John in his well-known
work <cite>Drill or Training</cite>, “must not be confounded with the
snappy drill of troops, and can, moreover, not be attained by
means of it. The straightjacket has never yet cured one
insane person; the soul cannot be disciplined through the
body. One must work from the inside and not from the
outside. It is of little value if the outer annular rings of
a tree are beautiful and regular; it will rot and die in spite
of its deceptive appearance; if its heart is not healthy, the
first storm may bring it down. The inner man must look
beautiful; firmness and steadiness are needed within; the
marching tread of feet on the drill ground plain are of no
moment; the beat of the heart filled with the spirit of self-sacrifice
is the important factor.”</p>

<p>It is well known that Emperor William I. changed the
title of the brochure <cite>Drill or Training</cite>, written by Archduke<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
John, to <cite>Drill and Training</cite>. Training necessitates a good
corps of instructors and a great deal of time, whereas drill
will accomplish in a shorter time results which are not so
enduring. It is again presupposed that the recruits are willing
to be trained, otherwise all efforts are unavailing. The
question whether the individual man can be influenced sufficiently
in a two years’ service period to overcome even
sentiments inimical to the state, instilled in him by friends
or relatives, can only be answered by the next war. To
answer this question at the present time would be premature;
but one thing is certain: the sharp word of command, the
whole influence of a well-organized body of troops, will
sweep along even the reluctant in the hour of danger.</p>

<p>The importance of the tactical formations which at
one time constituted minor tactics has doubtlessly decreased;
unfavorable formations, in so far as they increase or reduce
losses, increase or restrict one’s fire effect, can be offset by
the fighting efficiency of the soldier and by proper leading. The
unfortunate termination of the battle of Jena for the Prussian
arms, as already mentioned, bears no relation to drill as
such. The formations in themselves were not at fault, for
linear tactics scored the greatest successes in the Peninsular
war and at Waterloo; and at the Katzbach, Prussian battalions
of Borke’s Brigade in line overran the French
columns. Within certain limits, numerical inferiority and
lack of fighting efficiency can be offset by leadership. But
numbers and fighting efficiency will always remain the decisive
factors for success.</p>

<p>The victory of Spicheren was due primarily to the
troops and not to leadership. This is likewise true of
Wörth. The lion’s share in the victory of Vionville is certainly
due to the fighting efficiency of the gallant Brandenburgers.
Finally, at St. Privat, the crisis produced by the
commanders was successfully overcome only by the tenacity
of the troops, who maintained their positions for hours under
the most destructive hostile fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span></p>

<p>Increased demands must at present be made upon the
combat training of the soldier. The combat requires enterprising,
self-sacrificing, cold-blooded men who are imbued
with the spirit of the reckless offensive. “The combat requires
thinking leaders, <i>trained to rely upon themselves</i>, and
<i>skirmishers having initiative</i>.” (Par. 2 German I. D. R.).
“Judgment, self-confidence and boldness must be aroused
and continually developed in the young soldier.” (Par. 144
German I. D. R.). “The aim of all exercises should be
to develop the soldier into a self-thinking and conscientiously
working skirmisher.” (Par. 158 German I. D. R.). “All
training should be directed toward producing self-reliance
in leaders and in the individual skirmisher.” (Par. 251 German
I. D. R.). “The infantry must nourish the desire for
taking the offensive; its actions must be guided by the one
thought, <i>forward, at the enemy, no matter what the cost</i>.”
(Par. 265 German I. D. R.). “The continuous desire to
press forward and the endeavor to surpass all other units
must animate all parts of the attacking force.” (Par. 327
German I. D. R.). “It should be a point of honor with
skirmishers not to allow the supports to overtake them
earlier than the moment of penetrating the enemy’s position.”
(Par. 348 German I. D. R.). “Those who fall must
be left behind. These sacrifices should not lead to an abatement
of the pursuit any more than the losses sustained in
the previous fight caused the renunciation of the purpose of
the combat.” (Par. 424 German I. D. R.). “A commander
who is ever willing to shoulder responsibility will not shrink
from throwing troops into the fight <i>regardless of consequences</i>
even when the outcome of the battle is doubtful.”
(Par. 304 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>If love of life and fear of death are overcome in a
soldier by discipline, in an officer this must be brought about
by a higher sense of duty and honor. On the battlefield the
desire to live does not appear in a cultured person, as a rule,
in its ordinary, undisguised form; it makes itself felt rather<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
in the shape of tactical scruples, whether the leader would
be justified in leading his subordinates to certain death,
whether it would not be his duty to preserve the force entrusted
to him for more important duty in the service of the
fatherland, instead of sacrificing it uselessly. If, in addition,
an officer has been allowed, in time of peace, to criticise,
from the start, an order of his superior with reference to its
feasibility, it may easily happen in the stern reality of actual
war that a subordinate leader, neither especially courageous
nor ambitious, succumbs to the seductive whisperings of his
senses on the approach of danger and sees in caution the
better part of valor. It is always suspicious if troops have
become accustomed to consider insignificant losses, common
to colonial wars, accompanied by great physical exertions, as
indications of good leadership.<a id="FNanchor107" href="#Footnote107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Great victories are, as a
rule, invariably accompanied by great losses.</p>

FOR MINIMIZING LOSSES.</h3>

<h4>A. THE POWER OF FIELD ARTILLERY.</h4>

<h5>1. THE FIELD GUN.</h5>

<p>The field artillery of all the states that need be considered
is armed with a rapid-fire gun provided with shields and
capable under peace conditions of firing as many as twenty
shots per minute. Its caliber varies from 7.5 to 8.38 cm.
(Germany, 7.7; France, 7.5; Russia, 7.62, and England, 8.38
cm., the last-named being an 18 pdr.). The German gun fires
shrapnel weighing 6.85 kg. (the Russian, 6.5, and the French
7.25 kg.) and high explosive shell of approximately the same
weight, with an initial velocity of 465 m. (the Russian 588
and the French 530 m.). The projectiles are burst through
the action of combination fuzes (in Germany graduated to
5000, in France and Russia to 5500 m.). The projectiles
have a maximum range of 8000 m., when percussion fuze is
used. Canister has been replaced by shrapnel, which bursts
approximately 200 m. in front of the gun when the fuze is
set at zero. The German field artillery is also equipped with
a light field howitzer, cal. 10.5 cm., which fires shrapnel weighing
12.8 kg. (time fuze ranging from 300 to 5600 m.) and
shell weighing 15.7 kg. (time fuze ranging from 500 to
5600 m.). The Germans use heavy field howitzers (cal. 14.91
cm., firing shell that has an extreme range of 6870 m.) in the
heavy artillery of the field army. France uses the 15.5 cm.
Rimailho howitzer, England a 12.7 cm. howitzer and another
long piece of 12 cm. caliber.</p>

<h6 class="inline">Percussion shrapnel</h6>

<p class="hinline">is used for defense at short range,
and in fire for adjustment; its effect depends upon the range<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
and the nature of the ground. It is effective against troops
lodged in tall timber. Masks, branches of trees, etc., frequently
cause the premature burst of the projectiles.<a id="FNanchor108" href="#Footnote108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Percussion shrapnel is effective only when bursting immediately
in front of the target (5-25 m. in front of it,
depending upon the range). However, even in this case, the
bullets often pass over low targets, such as skirmishers lying
down, and low parapets afford sufficient protection. An
adequate effect can be obtained only when the fire is directed
on vertical targets. Soft ground, newly ploughed fields, terrain
covered with snow or underbrush, small folds of the
ground, or a rising slope, diminish the fire effect. When the
angle of fall is 10 degrees or more (with the German piece
at ranges of 3300 m. and over) half of the bullets penetrate
the ground, the remainder ricochet and pass on at a greatly
reduced velocity. The explosive or incendiary effect of shrapnel
is insignificant owing to the smallness of the bursting
charge. However, some incendiary effect is possible if the
projectile strikes an easily inflammable target.<a id="FNanchor109" href="#Footnote109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p class="hinline">(used in Germany up to 5000 m.) is
fairly independent of the terrain, the burst being<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
easily observed since the bullets are embedded in a “smoke-producing
composition.” The extreme range at which this
projectile can be employed is fixed by the facility of observing
the fire and by the remaining velocity of the shrapnel bullets,
both of which diminish as the range increases. Field guns,
model ’96, may be effectively employed up to a range of
4000 m.; under 3000 m. their fire is so annihilating that decisive
results are produced in a short time. (Par. 630 German
F. S. R.). The use of the combination fuze, on account of its
certainty of burst, either by time or percussion, permits the
trajectory to be accurately determined in every case. This
fuze also makes it possible to employ shrapnel against rapidly
advancing targets, and in warding off a sudden attack at short
range. The French Regulations give the width of the beaten
zone of a single shrapnel as 20, that of two from the same
piece as 25 m. The maximum depth of the beaten zone is
300 m. The angle of the cone of dispersion of the German
shrapnel, model ’96, is 16 degrees at 2000 m. German shrapnel
(model ’91) fired at a line of infantry did not strike lines
following 250 m. in rear of the first, whereas in case of base
charge shrapnel these lines would be safe only at 350-400 m.
from the first line. The German shrapnel gives very good
results when set to burst 30 to 150 m. in front of the target,
the height of burst being regulated accordingly (approximately
<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> of the whole number of hundreds of meters of
the range). At ranges under 1500 m., an adequate fire effect
may, however, be expected even when the fuze is set to burst
the projectile 300 m. in front of the target. (Par. 30 German
F. A. F. R.).</p>

<p>Shrapnel is most effective against skirmishers lying down
from 1000 to 3000 m. when burst 28 to 22 m. short, and
against standing skirmishers at the same ranges when burst 56
to 45 m. short. The two tables given below, borrowed from
the work of Lieutenant-General Rohne on artillery tactics,<a id="FNanchor110" href="#Footnote110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>

effect per minute of shrapnel fire after adjusting upon the
target:</p>

<p>More than 80% of the men struck by fragments and
bullets from shrapnel bursting within 100 m. are disabled.
The penetration of shrapnel bullets is so great, at ranges under
2000 m., that when they strike bones or vital organs of horses,
they produce instant incapacity for action. This is especially
true when the interval of burst is less than 100 m. The effect
of shrapnel directed against batteries provided with shields is
insignificant. Time shrapnel is the principal projectile employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
by artillery against animate objects, provided these are
not located immediately in rear of parapets, within tall timber,
or under bomb-proofs. This projectile is ineffective against
such cover on account of the flatness of the trajectory and
the sensitiveness of the fuze.</p>

<p>Shrapnel is to be supplemented by <b>shell</b> filled with explosive
charge, model ’88, which has a great explosive effect
at extreme ranges and in tall timber. (See pars. 159-160
German F. A. F. R., in regard to action against shielded batteries).</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>Targets located immediately in rear of parapets or under
light splinter proofs may be reached with time shell burst
directly over or close in front of them. The depth of the
beaten zone of this projectile is small, seldom exceeding 50 m.,
even when the fire is directed against targets in the open.
About 75% of all the fragments are capable of inflicting disabling
wounds when the interval of burst is short. The
peculiar character of the projectile necessitates a very careful
adjustment in range and in height of burst. The French <i>obus
allongé</i>, a high explosive percussion shell (melinite charge;
angle of the cone of dispersion exceeds 100 degrees) is employed
only for the destruction of material objects.<a id="FNanchor111" href="#Footnote111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote111" href="#FNanchor111" class="label">[111]</a> When firing on animate objects, the beaten zone of this projectile does
not exceed a space 50 m. wide and 20 m. deep, but the concussion of the
explosion will undoubtedly be felt at a greater distance. The explosive effect
of the projectile is equivalent to that of 30 kg. of powder. The explosion of
the projectile produces a cone-shaped crater having a diameter of 2 and a depth
of 0.50 m. Ten melinite shells per running meter are required to destroy a

<h4>2. THE LIGHT FIELD HOWITZER.</h4>

<p>The realization that the power of resistance of a defender
lodged in deep trenches, could not be broken by the fire of
guns having a flat trajectory, led to the re-adoption of a gun
capable of high angle fire, which had been eliminated from
the field artillery upon the advent of rifled cannon.<a id="FNanchor112" href="#Footnote112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote112" href="#FNanchor112" class="label">[112]</a> After March, 1859, the artillery of a mobilized Prussian army corps consisted
of three horse batteries, each armed with six 6-pounder guns and two
7-pounder howitzers; six foot batteries, each armed with eight 12-pounder
guns; and three foot batteries, each armed with eight 7-pounder howitzers.
Thus the artillery of an army corps numbered 30 howitzers and 66 guns.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>For both flat trajectory and high angle fire, the light
field howitzer, model ’98, employs shrapnel weighing 12.8 kg.
(500 jacketed bullets, @ 10 g.; time fuze graduated from
300 to 5600 m.) and shell weighing 15.7 kg. (0.37 kg. explosive
charge, model ’88; time fuze graduated from 500 to
5600 m.). As delay action fuzes are used, it is possible to
utilize to the fullest extent the power of penetration of the
projectile before it bursts.</p>

<p>A single shrapnel from a light field howitzer produces a
greater number of hits, when the point of burst is favorably<span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span>
situated, than one fired from a field gun. However, the
projectiles fired from the latter have a deeper beaten zone on
account of the flatter trajectory of the piece, and a greater
penetration owing to their greater remaining velocity. The
German Artillery Firing Regulations (par. 30) consider the
effect of both projectiles “very good” and of equal value at the
principal ranges, when burst at a moderate distance (30 to
150 m.) from the target. The effect of shrapnel from the
field gun and from the light field howitzer is considered
adequate at ranges under 1500 m., when bursts are regulated
to occur within 300 and 200 m., respectively, in front of the
target. The superiority of the shrapnel fired from a field gun
is due to the greater penetration of the jacketed bullets (a
result of greater velocity of the projectile itself at the point
of burst). But in this connection it is to be borne in mind
that the effect of single shots only is here considered. The
shrapnel fire of the field gun is considerably superior to that
of the howitzer. This is due to the fact that the howitzer
fires more slowly than the field gun and must expend twice
the weight of ammunition to produce the same results. If,
in addition, it is remembered that the field battery carries
approximately 2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> times as many shrapnel as the light field
howitzer battery, it is obvious that the fire of the former will
be 2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> times as effective, against targets in the open, as that
of the latter.</p>

<p>The superiority of the heavier projectile asserts itself
when it becomes necessary to destroy material objects.</p>

<p>The shell fired from pieces having a flat trajectory is
employed against troops immediately behind cover. The shell
is burst immediately in front of, over, or in rear of the target,
which is thus struck by splinters from above. The more nearly
perpendicular the splinters strike the target, and the greater
their number and weight, the greater will be the effect produced.
The angle of the cone of dispersion is about 200 degrees;
with appropriate points of burst, fragments weighing
15 g. (80%) incapacitate for action. In curved fire, at ranges<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
beyond 2100 m., shell with delay action fuze is capable of
penetrating the splinter proof cover usually employed in the
field. At ranges under 2100 m. its angle of fall is too small
to make an adequate effect certain.</p>

<h4>3. THE HEAVY FIELD HOWITZER.</h4>

<p>The heavy field howitzer employs shell weighing 39.5
kg., containing an explosive charge of 0.85 g., and fitted with
a percussion fuze either with or without delay action. This
shell is designed to penetrate the roofs of splinter proofs. An
earth covering 5-6 m. thick is necessary to afford protection
against these projectiles. At 3000 m. a 15 cm. shell produces
a crater 1 m. deep and 2.4 to 3.6 m. in diameter, <i>i.e.</i>, 2 cu. m.
(in made ground this crater is three times this size). The
heavy field howitzer is a very effective weapon against shielded
batteries. A single shell, owing to its lateral explosive effect,
is capable of placing a whole battery temporarily out of action.</p>

<h4>4. EXPEDIENTS FOR MINIMIZING THE EFFECT OF
FIRE.</h4>

<p>Movements of infantry under artillery fire are unavoidable
when firing lines are to be reinforced and when troops
intended for the decisive attack are to be pushed closer to the
enemy. Formations calculated to minimize the effect of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
hostile fire must be taken up in time, since it is not always
possible to make use of cover. The efficacy of the fire
depends upon the accurate determination of the range and
height of burst (fire for adjustment) and upon the careful
observation of the subsequent fire (fire for effect).<a id="FNanchor113" href="#Footnote113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The
effect of this fire is considerably increased when the opponent’s
infantry, against whom the fire is directed, takes up unsuitable
formations (particularly broad line formations). Infantry
has frequently found it advantageous to advance in small
detachments moving rapidly at irregular intervals in extended
order.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote113" href="#FNanchor113" class="label">[113]</a> The color of uniforms exerts considerable influence on observation. According
to experiments made in France, colors rank as follows as regards visibility:
white (invisible at night), light blue, alizarine red, green, dark brown, gray, or
yellowish brown. <cite>Schweizer Zeitschrift für Artillerie und Genie</cite>, 1896, I, p. 39.
The following colors protect against heat, in the order named (in reverse order
against cold): white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, black. The position
of gray in the list depends upon the amount of white or black mixed
with it.</p>

<h5>(a) Increasing the Difficulties in the Adjustment of the
Hostile Fire.</h5>

<p>A battery requires about 0.8 minutes (5 to 6 rounds
with percussion fuze) to secure adjustment at ranges up to
750 m. The time required for securing adjustment at the
longer ranges is as follows:</p>

<p>Narrow columns moving to their right or left front are
very unfavorable targets for artillery, as it is very difficult for
a battery commander to determine the relative position of
bursts on the flank of a column with respect to the leading
element thereof. Such shots are frequently considered as over.
Numerous small columns, which make it difficult to designate
a target, increase the time required by the hostile artillery to
secure adjustment.</p>

<p>Troops should not be posted in the vicinity of conspicuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
objects, as, for example, trees, visible at a great distance.<a id="FNanchor114" href="#Footnote114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Intrenchments that have just been thrown up should
be made to look as nearly as possible like the surrounding
country by covering them with snow, sod, or brush. It is
made more difficult for the hostile artillery to secure adjustment,
if our infantry changes position to the front or to a
flank, if it moves rapidly or advances by rushes.</p>

from Oct. 9th to 10th, and 100 per day from Oct. 11th to 16th, 1870, was
unsuccessful, because the percussion shells were ineffective. This will not be
changed in the future by the adoption of high-explosive shells. According to
<span class="smcap">Dick de Lonlay</span>, the garrison of the castle and its park lost only 5-10 men per
day during this time. The defensibility of the castle was not impaired, although
projectiles finally fell into the building itself during the sustained bombardment.
According to the same author (IV, p. 556) 1,022 shells fell into the park and
castle of Ladonchamps on October 7th, but only ten men were placed out of
action.</p>

<h5>(b) Minimizing the Effect of Fire.</h5>

<p>Formations that increase the effect of artillery fire, as
for example lines and columns, and positions in which a flank
is refused, should be avoided. It is a good plan to increase<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
the number of targets and to employ narrow columns (column
of twos) that are not too deep. Supports must be far enough
in rear (300-400 m.) to prevent two targets being struck
by one and the same shrapnel.</p>

<p>Of the close order formations used in the Russo-Japanese
war, platoons or sections in columns of squads or twos,<a id="FNanchor116" href="#Footnote116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
separated by a maximum interval of 50 paces, were indeed
found more suitable under fire than line formations, but the
losses were nevertheless very serious except where cover
screened the advancing troops from view or afforded them
actual protection.</p>

<p>During the Franco-German war, line of platoons in columns
of twos was found advantageous on several occasions.<a id="FNanchor117" href="#Footnote117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
This formation has the following disadvantages, however:
it is very susceptible to flanking fire; the influence of the
officers is principally restricted to the leading elements; intervals
are easily lost and on that account it becomes more difficult
to form line. It would seem to be better, therefore, to
advance in line of platoons (or sections) in columns of squads,
or, under flanking fire, in line of squads in columns of twos
or files. In the last-named formation the intervals between
squads are easily lost, however, and the company then becomes
a dense skirmish line of from four to six ranks. To echelon
the platoons slightly has very little value on account of the
depth of the beaten zone of modern shrapnel.</p>

<p>In attacks made during the latter part of the Russo-Japanese
war, both belligerents finally made use of thin successive
skirmish lines for advancing; these lines followed each
other at 200-300 m. and united again on reaching cover.</p>

<p><i>France.</i><a id="FNanchor121" href="#Footnote121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> According to the French Field Artillery Regulations
(footnote to par. 277), a gun firing time shrapnel
covers effectively a front of 25 m., and a battery of four
pieces, a front of 100 m. This intensity of fire, which is obtained
when each piece fires one shot with proper corrector
and range settings (the battery four shots) Aubrat calls
“<i>Density 4</i>.” When <i>rafale</i> fire (two shots per piece) is employed
against a front of 100 m., with proper corrector setting,
density 8 is obtained. When the front exceeds 100 m.,
the deflection of the pieces must be changed between successive
shots (<i>tir avec fauchage</i>). To obtain density 8 against
a front of 150 m., each piece must fire three shots, as prescribed
in the regulations. When progressive fire (<i>tir progressif</i>)
is employed, four different ranges are given, of which
only one can be considered effective. When not sweeping, in
this fire, each piece fires two shots, thus also obtaining a
density of 8. A density of 1 always corresponds, therefore,
to one round, fired, with proper corrector and range settings,
against a front of 100 m. When a battery (four pieces) fires
one salvo against a target having a front of 50 m., density 8
is obtained; by firing two salvos, density 16 is obtained.</p>

<p>A skirmish line 100 m. long, and lying down, would
suffer a loss of 15% irrespective of its strength, from progressive
fire (<i>tir progressif</i>; 32 rounds, density 8). If the
interval between skirmishers in the open amounts to 1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> paces,
for instance, the front would contain 62 skirmishers, and the
resulting loss would amount to 9 men. If the men have placed
their knapsacks in front of them, the loss would be reduced
by half. A line of skirmishers of the same length and strength
as the one considered above, would suffer a loss of 40%, or
25 men, when standing up or advancing. About 1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> minutes
are required to fire one <i>tir progressif</i>, after adjustment has
been secured. The same effect could be obtained in about 20
seconds by firing a <i>rafale</i> of eight rounds, provided the battery
has accurately adjusted its fire.</p>

<p>The wounds produced by shrapnel bullets are similar to
those caused by the lead bullets of the infantry weapons of
the past. When the bullet strikes normally to the surface, it
produces a wound circular at the point of impact and considerably
enlarged at the point of exit; bones are frequently
shattered; and the most serious effect is the introduction of
foreign substances, such as pieces of cloth, particles of earth or
sand, or of the material in which the bullet is embedded.</p>

<p>The effect of shrapnel bullets on animate targets depends
upon the striking energy of the bullets (expressed by kgm.)
and on their density, those of smaller cross-section having
the greater penetration. The closer the point of burst is
to the target, the greater the velocity, and, naturally, the effect.</p>

<p>Opinions differ as to the amount of “striking energy”
necessary to put animate targets out of action. In France,
an energy of at least 4.8 kgm. is considered necessary to disable
human beings, and for horses an average of 19 kgm., while in
Germany, an average energy of 8 kgm. is deemed sufficient.
The 10 g. hardened lead bullet, having a diameter of 12.3 mm.,
retains this energy until its remaining velocity is only 120 m.
At ranges up to 1500 m., over 80% of the men struck by
fragments and bullets from shrapnel, bursting within 300 m.
(and beyond this range from shrapnel bursting within 150 m.)
are put out of action. (Par. 30 German F. A. F. R.). In
comparison, artillery projectiles produce a greater number of
fatal wounds than infantry projectiles.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the packed knapsack affords<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
protection against all shrapnel bullets having a velocity of
100 m. and against half of those having a velocity of 200 m.
The overcoat roll stops shrapnel bullets having a velocity of
less than 250 m. The penetration of these bullets is so great,
at ranges under 2000 m., that when they strike bones or vital
organs of horses, they produce instant incapacity for action.
This is especially true when the interval of burst is less than
100 m.</p>

<p>The modern infantry rifle, cal. 6.5 to 8. mm., is a magazine
arm employing steel jacketed, pointed bullets, arranged in
clips. The adoption of automatic rifles is contemplated. In
these rifles the recoil energy is utilized for throwing out empty
shells and for placing a fresh cartridge into the chamber at
the same time. The objections made to the adoption of such
a rifle (complexity of the mechanism, danger of wasting ammunition)
are similar to the reasons advanced against the
adoption of breech-loading and magazine rifles. In addition
to the increased rate of fire, the advantage of eliminating the
effect of the recoil on the skirmisher must not be underestimated.
Moreover, the elimination of the recoil makes a
further increase in the initial velocity of the projectile possible.</p>

<p>The effect of infantry fire may be considered from two
points of view, viz.: the effect on the enemy of a single
projectile, and the effective hit in itself.</p>

<p>The ballistic qualities of the <i>Arisaka</i> rifle were superior
to those of the Russian arm, but the maiming effect of the two
rifles was about equal. The striking energy of the projectiles
was not sufficient in every case, however, to put a man out of
action. The explosive effect produced by bullets striking interior
organs and bones at short ranges (within 500 m.) was
more evident in wounds made by the 8. mm. than by the
<i>Arisaka</i> rifle.<a id="FNanchor125" href="#Footnote125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

“The projectile that penetrates animal organisms displaces and consequently
destroys the tissue fibers lying in its path. The projectile communicates
a portion of its energy to the molecules struck, and these in turn transfer
that energy to adjoining ones. The greater the velocity of the projectile at the
moment of impact, the more rapid is this transfer of motion. Especially in
organs filled with fluid are the molecules, like firm bodies, thrown with the
greatest rapidity. This has a destructive effect which in the past has never
been observed to be so extensive, and which gives the impression that the
projectile has exploded in the body. In order to produce this effect a velocity of
about 350 to 400 m. is required, which was, of course, not obtainable in rifles
of older pattern, and was only possible in the immediate vicinity of the muzzle.
Whenever the projectile strikes a marrow bone with great velocity it shatters
it completely at the point of impact, and splinters it to a considerable extent,
all because the bone is filled with a liquid substance.”
<span class="smcap">Rohne</span>, <cite>Schieszlehre für
die Infanterie</cite>, p. 69.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>At mid ranges the wounds were generally of a mild character,
unless produced by tumbling bullets.<a id="FNanchor126" href="#Footnote126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote126" href="#FNanchor126" class="label">[126]</a>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Experiments prove that a projectile will tumble if it encounters
varying resistance (for example, if the projectile
strikes an obstacle, even if that be only a twig) or if it penetrates
materials of different density (for instance, if, in penetrating
a body, it strikes first upon a fleshy part, then upon
bones). In the last mentioned case the bullet will frequently
tumble in the body. If a projectile be fired through a series<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
of boards, placed at intervals, it will tumble in the second
board, or if not there, then certainly in the third board.
Projectiles which ricochet on the ground before penetrating a
human body change their form more or less, according to the
character of the ground on which they ricochet. As the jacket
is frequently torn, thus exposing the leaden kernel, wounds
may be produced which will equal those made by explosive
bullets.</p>

<p>The striking energy of the projectile is sufficient to
perforate two men at 1200 m. From experiments made with
the <i>Lebel</i> rifle on corpses, it appeared that the projectile passed
clear through 5 bodies at 100 m., through 4 bodies at 400 m.
(even when large bones were struck) and through 2 bodies
at 1200 m.</p>

<p>In the Russo-Japanese war wounds were distributed as
follows, on a basis of 100 hits: lower limbs, 39.5; upper limbs,
25.4; abdominal region, 16.5; chest, 15.5; spinal column, 15,
and head, 11. Flesh wounds are generally slight. This is due
to the fact that the hole made by the bullet is small, that the
exterior flow of blood is insignificant, and that the wound
rarely becomes infected. Projectiles remain in the body now
much more rarely than in the past.</p>

<p>The central portion of marrow bones is frequently splintered
by projectiles, while thicker flat bones (shoulder blades)
are cleanly perforated.</p>

<p>Unless a tumbling bullet or a splinter of a bone penetrates
the lungs, chest wounds appear in much more favorable forms
than in past wars.<a id="FNanchor127" href="#Footnote127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote127" href="#FNanchor127" class="label">[127]</a> “A soldier of the 3rd East Siberian Regiment, who had been shot in the
chest, for instance, subsequently walked to the nearest railway station, a
distance of over 20 km., and felt fairly well except for a slight difficulty in
breathing. A lance corporal of the 36th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, having
received a similar wound, began his journey to the nearest railway station on
a two-wheeled cart. The motion of the cart nauseated him to such an extent,
however, that he preferred to complete the journey on foot, a distance of
30 km.” Dr. <span class="smcap">Seldowitschi</span> in <cite>Wratsch</cite>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>According to observations made in the Russo-Japanese
war, wounds in joints healed without suppuration, the joint<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
and its mobility being saved. Amputations were extremely
rare, and the surgeon’s skill was, as a rule, seldom necessary
in the treatment of shot wounds. Chest wounds were slight,
and often many men walked a few <i>versts</i> to the dressing station,
some of them complaining of difficulty in breathing. As
a rule, such wounds healed in fourteen days. Chest wounds
were more serious when the heart or the large blood vessels
were injured; but even in these cases cures were effected.
Abdominal wounds were not so serious as in the past. Contrary
to past experience, skull wounds, in which the projectile
had passed entirely through the brain, were treated with fair
success.</p>

<p>The campaigns in South Africa and Manchuria have
amply demonstrated that wounds produced by jacketed bullets
of small caliber are not so serious as those caused by 11 mm.
projectiles. In addition, these campaigns have shown that
a further decrease in caliber is undesirable from the tactician’s
point of view, for a hit by no means affords the certainty, in
every case, of putting a man, much less a horse, out of action.</p>

<p>Moreover, the wounded man is cured so quickly that in a
short time he can again participate in action. The British
report of losses for the battle of Paardeberg, on February 18th,
1900, contains the names of a great many men who were
wounded at Magersfontain on December 11th, 1899. According
to British statements, 40 men out of every 100, seriously
wounded by steel jacketed bullets, could be returned to duty
after 36 days of surgical treatment. Dr. Küttner estimates
that of 154 men hit in the chest, 73 were able to return to duty
with their organizations; while, out of 92 men wounded in the
knee, only 28 could be sent back to duty. Wounds produced
by the small caliber <i>Arisaka</i> rifle during the Russo-Japanese
war healed more rapidly than those caused by the Russian
weapon. Flesh wounds of Japanese soldiers, for example,
healed in ten days, those of Russian soldiers in four. The
following observations were made on wounds produced by the
Russian rifle: Within a week slight wounds were covered by<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
a scab; after three weeks they were covered by fresh skin and
a part of the wounded were then able to return to the front.
The remainder, irrespective of the number of wounds received
by any one individual, were ready for duty in seven months.
Wounds in which bones were perforated without splintering,
healed in four to six weeks, so that the men could return to
duty within four or five months after receiving the wound.
When bones were splintered the cure was, of course, considerably
retarded.</p>

<p>The ballistic advantages of a small-caliber projectile (undesirable
from the military surgeon’s point of view) have been
obtained by the adoption of a pointed-nose bullet (called the
“S” bullet in Germany and the “D” bullet in France).<a id="FNanchor128" href="#Footnote128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">IV. THE EMPLOYMENT OF INFANTRY FIRE.</h3>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Infantry fire may produce either a stunning and paralyzing
effect on the hostile forces, or it may gradually exhaust,
wear out, and consume them. The fire will have a stunning
and paralyzing effect when it is suddenly concentrated upon a
narrow front, thereby producing fear and terror, provided
actual losses are added to this moral effect.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the fire will gradually exhaust, wear
out, and destroy the hostile forces when it is distributed for a
prolonged period over an extended front. In this case the
material losses suffered and the exhaustion of his physical
energies may force the conviction on the enemy that he has no
longer a chance to gain the victory. This conviction will cause
a suspension of all his energies and consequently of his determination
to fight.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>At <b>Modder River</b> (28th November, 1899) the Boers opened fire on
the British at 1000 m., although they had intended to hold their fire until
the British arrived within 300 m. of the position.<a id="FNanchor129" href="#Footnote129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

1899.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>The miscarriage of the contemplated sudden burst of fire resulted in
a fire fight, which tended to destroy gradually the physical and moral
powers of the British. The Boers, however, gave this gradually destroying
fire a paralyzing effect by concentrating it suddenly and continuously
on tactically important targets that were comparatively easy to hit. Minarelli
makes the following comments on the attack made by the British 9th
Brigade and Brigade of Guards at <b>Modder River</b>: “All further attempts
to induce the Guards to advance had to be abandoned. For hours they lay
on the dearly bought ground under a blistering African sun, utilizing as
cover every ant hill, every tuft of grass, on the apparently deserted battlefield,
and being morally certain that to get up would draw a deadly hail
of shot.” In regard to the fight of the 9th Brigade, the same author
states: “Meantime the 9th Brigade fared no better. It had in part been
able to get a little closer to the enemy (550 to 900 m.), but was then
unable to advance farther. The actual losses were very small in the ten-hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span>
fight, amounting only to seven per cent. The Highland Brigade, surprised
at <b>Magersfontain</b>, fared still worse. The fight growing out of the
surprise lasted almost ten hours. At the short range at which this action
was fought, the Boer method of fire (<i>i.e.</i>, to fire only when an enemy
raised himself to get better aim, and then to employ only an effective concentrated
fire) necessarily produced a depressing effect.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>In order that such a fire effect may be obtained, it is
necessary that the individual soldier combine coolness and
presence of mind with good marksmanship, and that company,
platoon and squad leaders maintain fire control and fire
direction.</p>

<h4>1. FIRE DISCIPLINE.</h4>

<p>Fire discipline is indispensable to fire control and fire
direction. It embraces the conscientious execution of all orders
and signals, as well as the scrupulous observation of all
regulations bearing on the handling of the rifle and on combat
in general. Fire discipline must be maintained even
though the fire control and fire direction exercised by the
leaders is imperfect or ceases entirely in the course of the
action.</p>

<p class="highline15"><b>Fire discipline</b> requires:</p>

<p>Perseverance under hostile fire, even when that fire cannot
be returned; constant attention to the orders of the leaders,
and careful observation of the enemy. It requires further,
taking advantage of the ground; care in setting the sight and
in delivery of fire; an increase of fire by individuals whenever
the targets become more favorable, and a cessation of fire
when the enemy disappears; finally, economy of ammunition.</p>

<p>The decision is prepared by the fire of infantry, supported
by machine guns, field, and heavy artillery. The fire of
troops pushed to within short range of the hostile position will
in many cases suffice to induce the enemy to give way, so that
the assault encounters nothing but evacuated or feebly defended
works. The Boer war and the Russo-Japanese war<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
demonstrate that determined troops will hold a position until
the attacker has massed sufficient troops to charge, or at least
until he threatens to attack with the bayonet. Examples:
Terrayama, on October 11th, 1904. Assault made by the 2nd
Division on March 1st, 1905, at Mukden, on Redouts 17
and 18.</p>

<p>Training in bayonet fencing has by no means lost importance,
irrespective of the fact as to whether or not bayonets
will ever be crossed in future. “Bayonet fencing is one of
the most important means of strengthening the moral force
of the individual soldier; of developing in him energy,
initiative, and courage for making a dashing advance.”<a id="FNanchor130" href="#Footnote130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote130" href="#FNanchor130" class="label">[130]</a> <cite>Introduction to German Bayonet Fencing Regulations.</cite></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Since the armament of the different armies is almost the
same, good individual marksmanship, coolness, fire control
and fire direction, and firmly rooted fire discipline, are the
deciding factors in an action in which two equal skirmish lines
contend for the superiority of fire.</p>

<h4>2. FIRE CONTROL AND FIRE DIRECTION.</h4>

<p>The principal object of fire control and fire direction is to
bring about a superiority of fire at the decisive point by suddenly
concentrating the fire of a large number of rifles upon it.
This is the only way in which a moral effect may be produced
on the troops against whom the fire is directed, while, at the
same time, their losses attain such proportions as to become
unbearable. At mid and long ranges, the efficacy of fire depends
more on fire control and fire direction than upon good
individual marksmanship.<a id="FNanchor131" href="#Footnote131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Whenever the appropriate rear<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
sight elevation is not used, the densest portion of the cone of
dispersion will not strike the target, and the chances of its
hitting the target diminish as the error in estimating the range
and the standard of excellence of the marksmanship increase.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote131" href="#FNanchor131" class="label">[131]</a>
See <span class="smcap">Rohne</span>, <cite>Schieszlehre
für die Infanterie</cite>, 3rd Edition, p. 85. “The
importance of the line shot (<i>i.e.</i>, a hit on the vertical stripe through the center
of the German bull’s-eye target) in the marksmanship training of the soldier
should by no means be underestimated, but rather appreciated at its true
value. The line shot forms the basis of known distance firing, just as the
latter forms the basis of field firing. Instruction in line shooting (<i>i.e.</i>, hitting
the vertical stripe of the German bull’s-eye target) becomes a moral factor of the
highest value in field firing. It cannot be denied, however, that the importance
of the line shot, as such, decreases with the range. Likewise all attempts to
transfer the zone of the line shot from short to long ranges have completely
failed.” Captain <span class="smcap">Krause</span>,
<cite>Die Gestaltung der Geschoszgarbe der Infanterie</cite>,
Berlin, 1904, p. 1.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Fire control and fire direction lie in the hands of platoon
commanders,<a id="FNanchor132" href="#Footnote132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> who regulate the fire as their judgment dictates.
Fire control and direction embrace: the opening and
cessation of fire; the designation of a target and of the elevation
to be used; the kind of fire and its distribution; the number
of rounds to be fired, and the observation of the effect of
the fire. As a rule, the fire will be distributed over the whole
front, but portions of the hostile line that are not clearly
visible should by no means be neglected (distribution of fire).
Regulations prescribing the scope of authority of individual
leaders are not considered desirable. The platoon commander
possesses in his squad leaders a medium for communicating
with his platoon. (Pars. 162-165 German I. D. R.). The
movements of the skirmishers, the correct <i>comprehension of
the target</i>, the <i>distribution of fire</i>, the <i>rate of fire</i>, and the <i>employment
of the terrain to the best advantage</i>, are regulated
through the squad leaders. The lack of thoroughly drilled coöperation
on the part of squad leaders inevitably results, as
might be expected, in a so-called “skirmish mob.” The platoon
commander cannot communicate directly with every individual
man of his platoon, but he can control his platoon through his
eight squad leaders, who, by reason of their position in the
line, can exert the proper influence on their skirmishers.<a id="FNanchor133" href="#Footnote133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote132" href="#FNanchor132" class="label">[132]</a>
The <cite>Belgian Firing Regulations</cite> require that the officer directing and controlling
the fire fight be able to determine: 1. The time necessary to produce
a certain effect with a given number of rifles; 2. The number of rounds
necessary to produce a certain effect in a given period of time; 3. Whether a
given target justifies the expenditure of ammunition in view of the situation or
the efficacy of the fire. The requirements of the <cite>Italian Firing Regulations</cite>
are similar.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote133" href="#FNanchor133" class="label">[133]</a> Austria: The position of the platoon leader is not so definitely fixed as
in Germany; neither is it prescribed that squad leaders participate in the firing.
In skirmish line fire control and fire direction are to remain as long as possible
in the hands of the company commander. The battalion commander is charged
with concentrating and distributing the fire; with reinforcing, at the proper
time, the companies in the firing line; and with replenishing the ammunition.
At long ranges he designates the companies that are to fire, and also the position
from which fire is to be opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span></p>

<p>The squad leaders are charged with <i>constantly supervising</i>
the setting of sights; the distribution, the careful delivery,
and the rate of fire; and the expenditure of ammunition.</p>

<p><i>The squad leaders participate in the firing only</i> when
their duties as leaders permit; and this will frequently be the
case in a prolonged engagement in the same position, especially
at short ranges. These remarks apply also to the range
finders.</p>

<p>In Italy and Switzerland the squad leaders participate in
the firing when the whole platoon is engaged in a fire fight.
The advantage of thus gaining a few better shots for the firing
line is more than offset by the more careful supervision of
the skirmishers as is required in Germany, France and Austria.
The platoon leader unaided is in no position to supervise
the proper use of the rifle and the expenditure of ammunition;
his subordinates must assist him. It is also desirable
to relieve the company commander from the actual duty
of fire direction and fire control. The company commander
is responsible for leading the company on the battlefield; this
does not preclude his thoroughly supervising his platoons and
observing the effect of their fire.</p>

<p>“Whenever the company commander is in the firing
line, he selects and designates the target and gives orders for
opening fire. He announces the range found by the range
finders and observes the effect of the fire. Aside from this,
he leaves fire control and fire direction to his platoon commanders,
and interferes only when he desires to concentrate
the fire of several platoons, or of the whole company, on a
certain target, or when he observes something that has escaped
the notice of the platoon commanders.” (Par. 216 German
I. D. R.).</p>

<p>In the course of an action, fire control and fire direction
will frequently be imperfect, whether this be due to the loss
of the leaders, or to the difficulty of hearing commands in
the noise of the combat. To provide for such contingencies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
the skirmishers must be taught that, in the absence of fire
control and fire direction, they may fire (<i>not that they must
fire</i>) at all targets within 600 m.; that between 600 and 1200
m., they should fire at tall and wide targets only; and that, at
ranges over 1000 m., as a rule, they should not fire at all.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In the pamphlet entitled, <cite>Actual Experiences in the Russo-Japanese
War</cite>, p. 11, et seq., Captain <span class="smcap">Soloviev</span>, 34th East Siberian Rifle Regiment,
1st Siberian Corps, states: “*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* There was an almost ungovernable
tendency among the men, as soon as they had thrown themselves down, to
open fire without orders; paying attention neither to the target designated,
nor to setting their sights.</p>

<p>“This haste is, first of all, brought about by the desire of drowning
the consciousness of danger by means of increased activity. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* It
is simply impossible to control and direct the fire when the men have not
been carefully trained. The din of battle, the explosion of hostile projectiles,
and the thunder of our own artillery make such a deafening roar that
one can scarcely hear one’s own voice. The long firing lines make it
extraordinarily difficult to transmit orders; even squad commanders can
not make themselves understood. Volley firing must therefore be dispensed
with.</p>

<p>“Only whistle signals, if repeated by all non-commissioned officers,
can be heard; but the men must be trained to obey the whistle signal.
With strictness and application much can be accomplished in this direction;
it may even be possible to stop the firing along the whole length of
the deployed company in the hottest phases of the fight.</p>

<p>“The difficulties of fire control and fire direction increase in proportion
to the intensity of the hostile fire and the proximity of the enemy,
especially on the defensive. The men get more and more restless, their
nervous tension increases, the danger seems nearer and greater. In such
a moment the leader must make every effort to keep his men in hand, and
prevent the firing from degenerating into a wild blazing away at nothing.
This is always a sign that the leader has lost control of his troops.</p>

<p>“The greatest obstacle to good fire control and fire direction is the
nervousness that usually pervades troops which are not accustomed to
active service. Only thorough peace training and strict fire discipline
ensure the maintenance of order in battle and give the fire the necessary
efficacy. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The more laborious the struggle, the more embittered
the fight, the greater the losses, the more fatigue and nervous strain gain
the upper hand, the greater and more important the role which the officer
has to play. The success of the 200 men under his command depends
entirely upon the company commander. The war in the Far East might
well be called the war of company commanders. The soldiers watch their
leader constantly and attentively. Two hundred lives depend upon his
bearing, his determination, firmness, and personal bravery. The men judge<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
the situation, the imminence of danger, success and failure, by the conduct
of their leader. The authority of an officer may rise to great heights,
but it may also sink very low. To show depression or faint-heartedness
is fatal; the feeling of despondency is at once communicated to the men,
the leader loses control of his command, and the mischief is done.</p>

<p>“In battle, more than anywhere else, the officer must be a commander
and rule with an iron hand. Nowhere does discipline play as
great a role as in action. Woe to the troops who have not in time of
peace become thoroughly disciplined, to whom discipline has not become
second nature! They will pay dearly for this deficiency in war.</p>

<p>“I have observed that in the most critical situations a resolute shout,
in a correspondingly imperious tone, had a marvelously quieting effect
upon the men. It is likewise advisable to make, here and there, a remark
concerning routine duty. For example: ‘Why have the sights not been
set in that platoon? Platoon commander, see at once that it is done.’
Because the commander is angry, and notices neglect, everything goes
well, so the men reason, and no danger need be apprehended. The men
quiet down, forget the whistling of the bullets, set their sights carefully,
point their pieces properly, and aim again.”</p>

<h4>3. SELECTION OF THE LINE TO BE OCCUPIED.</h4>

<p>While a good field of fire is indispensable for reaping the
maximum benefit from the power of our rifles, the tactical
situation is the determining factor in the choice of a position.
The requirements as to a field of fire and the use to be made of
it will vary, depending upon whether it is desired to avoid
an engagement at short range (delaying action) or whether
a decision is to be sought (decisive action). In the first case
a free field of fire at short ranges may be dispensed with.</p>

<p>Cover may be used only to the extent that it does not
interfere with constant observation of the enemy. It is not
permissible to hide entirely behind cover, unless expressly ordered
in each case. To rise from behind cover, for the purpose
of firing, and to disappear subsequently behind that
cover for loading, is out of the question in the firing line.
This is physically impossible and much less attainable for
psychological reasons; in addition, the skirmisher will present
a much larger target than when lying down. When portions
of the firing line cannot see the target during an attack, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
platoon commander should consider this a hint, either to gain
a better position farther to the front, or to suspend his fire
temporarily. (Par. 190 German I. D. R.). In defense, in a
similar case, cross fire would frequently be the proper expedient.
The attacker will often see nothing except the heads
of the skirmishers who must fire kneeling in order to sweep
the foreground, while these men will present targets of half a
man’s height to his bullets. Since smokeless powder is employed,
it is important to select positions that cannot easily be
found by the enemy. Positions in which the skirmishers are
silhouetted against the sky line should be avoided whenever
possible. Faintly illuminated targets, or those lying in the
shade, are not fired on at all, according to all experience, while
the fire is above all else directed against sharply outlined targets.
The leaders must take to cover also, for in many cases
single officers standing upright draw attention to the position.
The extent of the position must be commensurate with the
strength of the force; too dense a line reduces the efficacy of
fire and increases the losses, while, on the other hand, too
dispersed a force increases the difficulties of fire control and
fire direction.</p>

<h4>4. THE STRENGTH OF THE FIRING LINE.</h4>

<p>This depends upon the purpose of the action. Although
a thin firing line may be employed when the situation is still
in doubt (protection against surprise), it must be strong when
the superiority of fire is to be attained. If the firing line is
made too weak, we are condemned to fight a superior force
continuously with an inferior one because we have voluntarily
sacrificed the advantage of our numerical superiority. On the
defensive, as soon as the direction of the hostile attack develops,
the firing line is made as strong as seems necessary
for holding the position. In a delaying action, however, we
should endeavor to place as few men in action as possible;
and to compensate for the lack of rifles by an increased expenditure
of ammunition. All firing is done from the prone
position, in so far as the ground permits. The French attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
to regulate the volume of fire by prescribing the number of
rifles to be employed instead of designating the kind of fire to
be used.</p>

<p>In Switzerland and England,<a id="FNanchor134" href="#Footnote134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> it is recommended that
supports use “Fire of position” where the terrain is suitable
(hilly country). The German Infantry Drill Regulations
(par. 340) contain a similar provision. When the supports
cannot see the firing line on account of the conformation of
the ground, this fire is not likely to endanger the latter.</p>

<h4>5. ASCERTAINING RANGES.<br />
<span class="nonbold">(Pars. 78-98, 190 and 191 German I. F. R.).</span></h4>

<p>Efficacy of fire depends upon a knowledge of the range.
An imperfect knowledge of the range may be compensated
for by the flatness of the trajectory of the individual rifle and
by the favorable conformation of the ground in respect to the
cone of dispersion. In collective fire, at mid and long ranges,
each rear sight graduation commands a beaten zone approximately
100 m. deep&mdash;good aim, proper elevation, and careful
firing being presupposed. The nearer the target is to the
densest portion of the cone of dispersion, the greater the
efficacy of the fire.</p>

<p>The following results were obtained in Italian firing
tests in which 100 skirmishers fired at a plate 1 m. high and
30 m. wide with the 6.5 mm. rifle:</p>

approximately to one-eighth (12.5%) of the range;<a id="FNanchor138" href="#Footnote138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> this
may be corrected by taking the mean of a considerable number
of estimates, or by employing combined sights at ranges
over 1000 m. (the difference between rear sight elevations
being 100 to 200 m.), thus increasing the depth of the beaten
zone. The accuracy of the resulting fire is influenced by local
and atmospheric conditions. (Par. 80 German I. F. R.). Estimates
usually fall short of the correct distance when made
in bright sunlight; in clear atmosphere; when the sun is in
rear of the man estimating; when made over uniform surfaces;
over water; when the target is set off by a bright background;
when made over rolling ground, especially when the
several depressions cannot be seen. On the other hand, estimates
frequently exceed the correct range when made in a
flickering light; against a dark background; against the sun;
when the sky is overcast; during foggy weather; in the dusk;
in woods; and against an enemy who is only partially visible.
According to the Swiss Firing Regulations (1906) estimates
made from a height downward are usually too short, and those
made from low ground up, too great.</p>

<p>The Russian range finding instrument (<i>Souchier</i>) is used by officers
and specially trained non-commissioned officers; errors in determining
ranges are not to exceed a maximum of 2-3 per cent.</p>

<p>In <b>Switzerland</b> recruits are trained to estimate distances up to 600
m. and specially skilled men up to 1500 m.; all non-commissioned officers<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
estimate ranges up to 1000 m. and officers up to 1500 m. Three weeks
after the recruits join, those of the most skilled in estimating distances&mdash;about
an eighth of the total number&mdash;are selected to undergo further
instruction. For this purpose they are placed under the orders of an
officer charged with this instruction, who trains them for at least three
hours, every other day, in estimating distances on varied ground. The
better half of these men, regardless of the company to which they may
belong, receive further instruction. Exercises on wholly unknown terrain
are to be had with these men and not only extended marches but even
railway journeys not exceeding 30 km. are authorized for this purpose.</p>

<p>In <b>Austria</b> the men are required to estimate distances up to 800 paces
(600 m.), <i>i.e.</i>, up to the range within which they might frequently have
to choose their target independently. Only officers, non-commissioned
officers, and specially skilled men are required to estimate ranges up to
2000 paces (1500 m.). The mean error of twenty determinations at short,
mid, and long ranges, of a “reliable range finder,” is not to exceed 12 per
cent. The <i>Roksandic</i> range finding apparatus is said to give errors not
exceeding 2-3 per cent when skillfully used.</p>

<p>To memorize distinguishing marks on the enemy as an
aid in arriving at a correct estimate of the range, is not considered
as simulating actual service conditions, since the power
of vision of the men differs. Furthermore, one sees the
enemy mostly in a prone position in action, and it is not to be
expected that the men will remember the various rules for
determining the range by the appearance of the enemy’s
skirmishers. The same is true of the regulation which prescribes
that the soldier estimating the range is to judge the
effect which the target makes upon him. (England and
Austria).</p>

<p>It will rarely be practicable for infantry to scale the range
directly from a map. Infantry ranges are usually so short,
in comparison to the scale of most of the maps, especially
those available in the field, that it is difficult to take them
between the points of a pair of dividers. Moreover, in an
infantry action conspicuous objects are not likely to be located
often enough near the position of the skirmishers to make it
practicable to find them quickly even on the most accurate
maps. The artillery is much better off in this direction; its
ranges are longer and therefore more easily scaled from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
map. Moreover, artillery is generally posted on or near
prominent points, which may be found on almost any map.
It should be remembered that a map is a horizontal projection,
that any range scaled from a map is the base of a right triangle,
and that the line of sight of a rifle, when firing uphill,
follows the hypotenuse of that triangle.</p>

<p>An accurate knowledge of the range to within a meter
is not necessary, as meteorological conditions,<a id="FNanchor140" href="#Footnote140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> especially temperature
and illumination (degree of humidity of the atmosphere)
affect the range of the projectile. Meteorological
conditions may necessitate sight corrections amounting to 100
m. at mid ranges and to 150 m. at long ranges. According
to the French Firing Regulations a difference of temperature
of ±10 degrees C., changes the range of the Lebel rifle by
18 m. at 1000 m. The altitude of the terrain increases the
range on account of reduced barometric pressure; this becomes
a factor in the selection of a rear sight elevation at an
altitude of approximately 1000 m. According to the French
Firing Regulations, the range of their rifle at 1000 m. is
increased as follows: At an altitude of 500 m. by 18; at 1000
m. by 42; at 1500 m. by 63; and at 2100 m. by 89 m.</p>

par. 70 Austrian I. F. R. The effect of temperature and of the altitude of the
battlefield was strikingly illustrated in the Boer war.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>These meteorological influences can be eliminated by
obtaining the range from troops already engaged (artillery)
or by determining the proper rear sight elevation (not the
range) by trial volleys (pars. 190 and 191 German I. F. R.)
or by an animated fire at will (Switzerland: fire at will, one
round).</p>

<p>To ascertain the range by firing trial volleys is, however,
practicable only when the terrain near the target is visible;
when the target itself is stationary; when the ground is such
that the strike of the bullets can be observed; when the firing
party is not under fire; and, finally, when the necessary time
is available. Since all of these preliminary conditions will<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
rarely be fulfilled, it will only in exceptional cases be possible
to determine the proper elevation by this method.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>When this method is employed, volleys are fired either by sections
or by platoons, with the same sight, at some one point of the target.
For the first volley a rear sight elevation sufficiently below the proper
one should be selected, so that hits on or in front of the target can be
expected with certainty. This procedure is then repeated, as often as
necessary, with correspondingly raised or lowered rear sight leaves, until
the correct elevation is obtained.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>This “ranging” by trial volleys promises no result, however,
if any one of the above-mentioned preliminary conditions
is not fulfilled. It is advantageous to establish a bracket
by firing volleys, as is done by artillery, but even with a good
glass it is very difficult to observe the strike of small caliber
bullets. Whether it would be advisable to adopt for this ranging
a specially designed weapon, firing thin-walled shell weighing
about 400 g., is a question.<a id="FNanchor141" href="#Footnote141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>The older range finding instruments depend upon angle
measurements at both ends of a line (up to 25 m. long). The
large range finder (<i>Hahn</i>) has been adopted in the German
army. (Pars. 88-98 German I. F. R.). This apparatus permits
a range to be measured from one point, up to 1200 m.

standing, up to 1600 m. Measurements are considered sufficiently
accurate when the error amounts to</p>

<p>On the defensive the large range finders will find employment
before and during the action. The men charged
with the measurement of the range should be careful not to
betray the position by their activity, before fire is opened.
The utility of these instruments is much more restricted in
an attack. However, it will often be possible, before the fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
fight begins, to ascertain the range from the point selected
for the first firing position, to the position to be attacked.
According to Soloviev range finders failed completely in action
in Manchuria. (See <a href="#Page137">p. 137</a> supra).</p>

<h4>6. SELECTION OF A TARGET AND TIME FOR
OPENING FIRE.</h4>

<p>In selecting a target and opening fire it must be remembered
that the fire cannot have a decisive effect unless the
target is well within effective range. The leader should ask
himself whether the result to be expected is properly commensurate
with the probable expenditure of ammunition entailed,
and whether this expenditure is warranted in view of the
total amount available. But the decision to fire upon a target
once made, the ammunition necessary for the attainment of
the object of the fight must be expended without stinting, since
all experience teaches us that an ineffective fire impairs the
morale of one’s own troops, while it raises that of the enemy.</p>

<p>In the selection of a target, its tactical importance is the
principal determining factor. The fire is first directed upon
the most dangerous, generally the nearest target, or the one
which is soon to become the most dangerous. Subsequently
the fire should be directed upon targets which, owing to their
height, width, depth, and density, promise the greatest number
of effective hits.</p>

<p>Infantry will, as a rule, offer the most important and
promising target, and the fire should be directed against the
firing line, since the troops following it in close order will in
any event come within range during their advance. In Italy,
when two targets are available, the fire is to be directed on
the one promising the best results.</p>

<p>Ballistic and tactical considerations determine whether
fire should be opened at long or at short ranges.</p>

<p>Adequate results may be expected when the fire is directed
against low targets at ranges of 800-1200 m., but at ranges<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
over 1200 m. a decisive effect is only attainable by the expenditure
of a large amount of ammunition. Skirmishers
standing may be fired on with good effect even at ranges over
1200 m. (long ranges).</p>

<p>When the fire is properly controlled and directed, it will
be effective against tall and deep targets within ranges corresponding
to the highest graduations of the rear sight leaves.
However, when the targets are narrow, a side wind is very
apt to throw the cone of dispersion off the target.</p>

<p>The idea of using our accurate, long range rifle at long
ranges in defense, thus bringing it into effective play, at a
time when the danger to our own troops is still very small,
is, at first glance, very tempting. Military history shows that
such fire was successful here and there, especially where one
of the contending parties was armed with a much superior
weapon, or where the enemy failed to apply the proper remedy.
But even in these cases it was successful only up to a
certain point. There is this to be said against employing long
range fire: Its effect is insignificant when compared with
the expenditure of ammunition entailed; it is difficult to
replenish ammunition and it tires the eye and the arm of
the skirmisher. Poorly trained troops finally do not raise
their rifles at all, but blaze away without aiming. To be sure,
fire opened at an early moment annoys the advance of the
enemy, but it cannot seriously retard it. Once the fire is
opened, we want it to be effective; we don’t want to injure the
enemy&mdash;we want to annihilate him.</p>

<p>Although we fully appreciate the good results obtained at
long ranges on the target range, we prefer to utilize the entire
staggering fire effect of our weapons at short and mid ranges,
wholly for the purpose of annihilating the enemy.</p>

<p>Since only small targets, often scarcely discernible by
the naked eye, present themselves to the attacker, the fire of
the defender should not be returned at once. The forward
movement should be continued by utilizing every expedient<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
(rushes with breathing spells, and cover) until serious
losses are sustained and the leader has reason to fear that his
men will lose their morale and throw themselves down without
orders. Frequently several groups will open fire while
the others continue to advance. The endeavor should be to
open fire only when the attacking force has gotten as close as
possible to the lower limit of mid combat range (800-1200
m.).<a id="FNanchor142" href="#Footnote142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote142" href="#FNanchor142" class="label">[142]</a> At Paardeberg (18th March, 1900), the left wing of the Highland Brigade
advanced, without firing a shot, to within 450 m. of the hostile position. This
advance, to be sure, was made under cover of the fire of the right wing of the
9th Brigade, which had made a lodgment within 750 m. of the enemy’s position.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Errors in estimating the range are offset by the flat trajectory
of the rifle only at short ranges, and only at these
ranges can there be any question of an effective preparation of
the attack by fire. These views are expressed in the German
regulations.</p>

<p>Recent wars demonstrate that, whenever the attacker
opened fire at long ranges, the attack finally came to a standstill,
that the troops in many cases fired away all their ammunition,
and that the whole attack failed.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>“Whenever the attacking regiment opened fire this was unfortunately
a sign that the attack had been repulsed.” This remark made by
Kuropatkin in regard to the fight of the Russian infantry (center group)
on Sept. 11th, 1877, at <b>Plevna</b>, is characteristic of the Russian ideas. On
the occasion referred to, the Russians advanced on the Turkish works
without fire preparation; the firing lines halted 400 to 600 m. from the
Turkish position and commenced firing. They succumbed because it
never occurred to the leaders to reinforce them and attempt to gain a
superiority of fire. Even in Skobeleff’s attack there was no sign of actual
fire preparation, but, as soon as the line halted, strong reinforcements
were pushed in to carry it forward. The attack, made on a front of
about 800 m., suffered heavy losses, but succeeded, although all organizations
were in complete disorder. After advancing 1000 m., the
decimated first line (8 battalions) halted; fifteen fresh companies
carried it forward some 150 m.; then Skobeleff threw in twenty companies
in one body, which carried the line forward to within approximately
100 to 150 m. of the work. At this moment Skobeleff threw himself
into the fight and succeeded in taking the Turkish position with his
badly cut up troops. Doubtless an act of undeniable gallantry, but not one
worthy of imitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span></p>

<p>The war between Servia and Bulgaria (1885) is very instructive
in this connection. As in 1859, 1870 and 1877, that force was defeated,
which, trusting to the superiority of its rifles, opened fire at long ranges.
The Servian skirmishers often did not even get within decisive range of
the position of their opponents.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The British infantry, armed with a long range rifle
equipped with an excellent rear sight arrangement, allowed
itself to be enticed, by the long range fire of the Boers, into
opening fire at 1200 and 1300 m. (Guard at Modder River)
and even at 1600 and 1700 m. (6th Division at Paardeberg)
against an enemy whose position was not discernible even
through the most powerful glasses. The losses were small
and not to be compared with those which our Guard suffered
without firing, during their advance on St. Privat. The advance
of the Gordon Highlanders at Doornkop (29th May,
1900) to within short range of the hostile position, without
firing a shot, although they themselves were under fire from
2000 m. on, was splendid.<a id="FNanchor143" href="#Footnote143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Since the assailant presents larger targets than the defender,
and the latter can make preparations for firing, ascertain
ranges, construct rifle-rests, and replenish ammunition
without difficulty, it is proper in defense to open fire at long
ranges, especially in delaying actions, for then fighting at short
ranges is to be avoided in any case. It is absolutely correct
for the defender to make the most of the advantages above
mentioned. While everything is orderly and in readiness in
the defender’s firing line, the attacker’s line is still in the process
of forming. Should the defender wait until the hostile
firing line has systematically deployed and has made a lodgment
within short range of his position, or should he produce losses
and create confusion in its ranks by suddenly opening fire?</p>

<p>The employment of long range fire on the defensive is
justified when sufficient ammunition is available, when artillery
is not present, and when the hostile infantry pursues the
tactics of advancing to short range without firing. “Infantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
should never attempt to take the place of artillery at long
ranges or compete with the fire of that arm.” If it is important
for the attacker to reach the extreme limit of mid ranges
with as little firing as possible, the defender should in the first
place fire on him with artillery, and, when this does not suffice
or is not available, with infantry, so as to prevent him
from accomplishing his object.</p>

<p>At mid ranges the efficacy of the defender’s fire is so
great, when directed upon an infantry line advancing without
fire support, that it becomes an important factor. At ranges
from 1000 to 600 m., 8 to 25% hits can be counted on when
the fire is directed against advancing skirmishers; and even
assuming an error of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> in the estimated range, 3 to 12% hits
may still be expected. (Par. 623, p. 196, German I. F. R.).</p>

<p>If the attacker is unable to hide from the defender’s fire
by using cover, his losses will increase until they become unbearable;
his attack will hesitate, and he will commence firing.
Fresh troops are necessary to carry the attacking line forward
anew. The success of the defense is assured, if the defender
is able to prevent the attacking force from getting within short
range of the position. The defender’s chance of making a
successful counter-attack disappears, however, as soon as the
attacking force makes a lodgment within short range of the
position; for the closer the defender is pressed, the closer will
he be tied to his position. While the superiority of fire
enjoyed by the defender at mid ranges allows him perfect freedom
of action, at short ranges the attacker’s fire imposes conditions
upon the defense which make the growing power of
the attack sensibly felt. The moment the defender begins
firing, however, he becomes at once a favorable target for the
artillery of the attacking force. The defender frequently betrays
his position prematurely by opening fire.</p>

<p>The <i>moral effect</i> of withholding the fire (<i>fire surprise</i>) is
very great.<a id="FNanchor144" href="#Footnote144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
A strong fire will be actually annihilating if<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
suddenly directed upon the enemy at short ranges, especially
if he is still in unsuitable formations, owing to his ignorance
of the defender’s position. (Example: The British brigade
under Hart at Colenso, 15th Dec., 1899, and the Highland
Brigade at Magersfontain, 11th Dec., 1899) or if the morale
of his troops is questionable.<a id="FNanchor145" href="#Footnote145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> What good troops should do
in such a situation (employ rapid fire and then advance to
the assault) is shown by the conduct of the IInd Battalion of
the 20th Infantry at Coulomiers.<a id="FNanchor146" href="#Footnote146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Steady nerves and iron
discipline are, however, prerequisites for the execution of a
fire surprise by the defender.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote144" href="#FNanchor144" class="label">[144]</a>
Marshal <span class="smcap">Bugeaud</span> gives a very graphic description of the moral effect of
fire in his <cite>Aperçus sur quelques détails de guerre</cite>, based upon his experiences in
the fights with the British in the Peninsula: “The men began to get excited
when still 1,000 m. from the enemy; they talked to each other; the march
became more and more hurried; and disorder appeared here and there in the
columns. The British remained quietly at order arms; their calm demeanor
was not without effect upon our young soldiers. We approached closer, the
men shouting: ‘<i>Vive l’empéreur! En avant, à la baionette!</i>’ Shakos were
raised upon the points of bayonets; the march became a double time; the ranks
became mixed; the excitement caused confusion here and there; and a few
shots were fired from the column. The British continued to stand immovable,
and seemed to pay no attention to us even when only 300 paces separated the
two forces.</p>

<p>“The contrast was apparent. Everyone felt that he would have to deal
with an opponent tried in battle; that the fire so long withheld by the enemy
would surely be annihilating. Our fighting ardor cooled; the moral power
which calmness, even when only apparent, exercises over confusion, which seeks
to drown itself in noise, made itself felt in our ranks. At this moment, when
the highest tension had been reached, the British line raised its rifles&mdash;an indescribable
feeling rooted many of our men to the spot&mdash;and began to fire. The
volleys, coolly delivered against a narrow front, plowed through our ranks; we
wavered, decimated though we were, in order to recover; then three overpowering
cheers from the opponents’ line, which rushed forward to the bayonet attack, and
everybody turned to seek safety in disorderly flight.”</p>

<p>Long range fire was employed with success on the defensive
by the French at St. Privat (the Germans suffered
the most serious losses at ranges from 1200 to 1000 m.) and
by the Turks at Plevna. At 1500 m. the Russian losses were
such that they were obliged to begin advancing by rushes. The
losses decreased as the enemy’s position was approached. The
long range fire had produced a retarding but by no means an
annihilating effect. On the other hand, the fire of the defender,
at extremely short ranges, had a telling effect at<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>

in the defense of Shipka Pass (200 to 300 paces) by the Russians,
and in the engagement at Gorni Bugarov (1st Jan.,

while still in unsuitable formations, his losses increase until
they become annihilating. (Example: The bayonet attacks

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>Austria.</b> “<i>In attack, everything must be done to get as close as possible
to the enemy before fire is opened.</i>” In each fire position the fire
should be delivered with steadiness and without haste.</p>

<p>In <i>defense</i>, fire is to be opened as soon as appropriate targets appear
within effective range. Sometimes&mdash;especially in minor operations&mdash;it
may be advantageous to let the enemy come up close and then open
fire on him suddenly.</p>

<p>A decisive fire effect can only be counted on when the targets are
situated within effective range. Ineffective fire is a waste of ammunition
which impairs the morale of one’s own troops and raises that of the
enemy. For firing at long ranges it is necessary to consider whether
a sufficient amount of ammunition is available. Long range fire should,
in any case, be used only when the size of the target makes an adequate
fire effect probable, and when the range is known, or can be ascertained
with accuracy. In long range fire the use of small units, each expending
a large amount of ammunition, is as a rule to be recommended. The
<i>distribution</i> and <i>concentration</i> of fire should be regulated by the officer
charged with fire direction.</p>

<p>“<i>Effective fire, delivered suddenly, especially when taking an enemy

has used up all, or nearly all, of his reserves, comparatively small detachments,

about the decision, if they are able to get on the enemy’s flank or rear<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
and open fire on him suddenly at short range.” Such fire surprises should

<p><b>France.</b> In <i>attack</i>, fire is opened as late as possible, at any rate not
until the losses make it necessary to discontinue the forward movement.
Fire is the only means which makes a further advance possible.</p>

<p>In <i>defense</i>, long range fire may be used under certain circumstances.
“Sudden and violent rafales delivered at short range take the attacker by
surprise if, all at once, he loses a great many men.”</p>

<p><b>England</b> (1905). <i>Attack.</i> Infantry is to advance as close as possible
to the enemy before opening fire; small losses must be endured. Fire is
decisive under 540 m. (600 yds.). Artillery and infantry should support
each other. Attention is called to the support afforded advancing
skirmishers by the fire of infantry units and machine guns held in rear.
The British are thus the first to prescribe “fire of position.” Their Firing
Regulations require that “fire of position” be practiced by company at a
range of 900 m. The company forms line of skirmishers (2-pace intervals)
while movable disappearing targets are placed opposite it. The fire
is to increase in intensity when the attacking infantry advances over level
ground or finds obstacles; it is discontinued when cover is reached. “Fire
of position” is not without danger, but seems to be practicable occasionally.
Aside from its employment in “fire of position,” long range fire is
to be used in attack in the following cases: In enveloping movements for
the purpose of enfilading the enemy’s line; when favorable targets present
themselves; in containing actions or in feints; in concentrated collective
fire; and finally in pursuit. <i>Defense</i>: Fire is to be opened at
1000 m. on skirmishers, but it may be advantageous to withhold it until
the hostile line comes within short range. This will give good results
when the enemy is in ignorance of the defender’s position, or when the
attack is made by poorly disciplined troops. Continued long range fire
tires the eye and the hand.</p>

<p><b>Italy.</b> In <i>attack</i>, the firing line is to reach the extreme limit of short
range (500 m.) with as little firing as possible; to open fire before this
with a part of the advancing force is only permissible when necessary to
carry the line forward. <i>Defense.</i> As soon as the defender has a chance
of obtaining some fire effect, he should open fire to prevent the attacking
infantry from getting within short range. Fire at long (up to 1800 m.)
and at mid ranges (up to 1000 m.) may also be used for this purpose.
The battalion commander determines when fire is to be opened.</p>

<p>From what has been said in the preceding pages as to the
time when infantry should open fire, we may deduce the following
<b>General</b> <span class="nowrap"><b>Rules</b>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span></p>

<p>It is permissible to open fire at an early moment only in
exceptional cases when the situation requires it; good preparation,
which assures the efficacy of fire and a high moral
effect from the very beginning, is of greater importance.</p>

<h6>(a) IN ATTACK.</h6>

<p>The attacker should advance without firing to ranges at
which an adequate fire effect against the low targets presented
by the defender may be expected. To open fire at an
earlier moment is permissible only when the defender’s fire
is so strong that effective ranges cannot be reached without
firing. Long range fire is only a means to an end. In a pursuit
long range fire will, however, be employed for the purpose
of annoying the enemy.</p>

<p>Fire may be opened at long ranges when sufficient ammunition
is available, only when the object is to gain time,
and in decisive actions, when the enemy presents favorable
targets and we have no artillery. Unless other reasons prevent,
fire is opened as soon as targets are clearly discernible
and easily brought into line with the sights. It is advisable
to withhold the fire when the hostile artillery is superior, when
the opponent’s troops are of poor quality, and when it is impossible
to surprise the enemy with our fire while he is in unsuitable
formations. In defense, as in attack, the decision
must be sought by the employment of rapid fire at short range.</p>

A Russian company commander contributes the following in <cite>Mitteilungen
der Infanterie Schieszschulen</cite>: “On Sept. 3rd, 1904, the fire in one of the
trenches at Liao Yang lasted throughout the entire day. The men were finally
completely exhausted; their shoulders, hands and fingers stiff. They had to be
given some rest, and something to eat and drink. Then the fire was resumed,
only to die down again. The fire of the skirmishers was not very effective, as
they were completely exhausted and used up.”</p>

<p><b>Swiss.</b> Firing Regulations p. 44: “It may be advantageous in defense
to fire on the attacker only until he himself opens fire, and then to<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
remain under cover until he resumes his forward movement. A prompt
resumption of the fire by the defender must, however, be assured.”</p>

<p><b>France.</b> “The fire should cease when the hostile infantry halts and
takes to cover; its volume is increased as soon as the assailant resumes
his forward movement, or when he shows himself in dense formations
on open ground.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The efficacy of fire depends upon its accuracy, its direction
with reference to the target, and its volume. In the past,
pauses in the fire were necessary to allow the powder smoke
to clear away; at present they are of advantage because they
give the men a breathing spell; rest eyes and nerves; enable
ammunition to be distributed, and allow preparations to be
made for concerted action. In making use of such pauses
good cover, good observation of the enemy and instant
readiness for resuming the fire are essential. In a serious engagement
the men either maintain a vigorous, animated fire
or they rest. If the advancing enemy takes to cover, the fire
must cease, only to be resumed with full vigor when favorable
targets appear. The attacker (like the British in
South Africa advancing against the Boers) will in many
cases&mdash;especially at the beginning of a campaign&mdash;be deceived
into believing that the defender has withdrawn; should
the attacker now advance, the defender, by suddenly resuming
his fire, will surprise him to such an extent that he may be
repulsed.<a id="FNanchor152" href="#Footnote152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Pauses in the fire are a practical expedient for
maintaining fire discipline and enable the leader to keep his
troops in hand. An organization is capable of performing its
duty well, so long as it obeys the command “cease firing.” It
might be well at this point to determine when the defender
should <i>change his rear sight elevations</i> if the attacker advances
by rushes. At mid ranges it might be advisable to stop firing,
so as to present no target to the enemy when his line throws
itself down after a rush, and to utilize this interruption for<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
changing the rear sight elevation. When this is done during
a forward rush of the enemy, the rapidity of fire will suffer
at the most favorable moment for bringing an effective fire to
bear upon the enemy.</p>

<h4>8. KINDS OF FIRE.</h4>

<p>In the days of slow loading rifles of limited range, the
importance of the <i	>volley</i> was due to the fact that it enabled the
leader to develop the greatest volume of fire in tactically favorable
moments, or, in other words, when large targets were
visible for a short time. Modern combat is conducted under
different conditions. When black powder was used the volley
had the advantage of permitting the powder smoke to clear
away during the pauses. This advantage has now also disappeared.</p>

<p>In the Russo-Japanese war, the Japanese used “fire at
will” almost exclusively. Volleys were used by them only at
long ranges; by troops held in rear and, after an assault, to get
the men in hand. These views are not changed in the new
regulations, but immediately after firing a volley the men are
to re-load without command. Rapid fire is retained. The
Russians placed their faith principally in volley fire,<a id="FNanchor153" href="#Footnote153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> but
were soon forced to resort to fire at will. The Russian regulations
recommended volley fire up to the decisive firing position,
not so much because of a belief in the superior efficacy
of this kind of fire, but out of distrust of the individual training
of their men; certainly an admission of the deficiency of
that kind of training in their army. It was feared that fire
at will would impair fire discipline and cause waste of ammunition,
and it was believed that the immediate influence of
superiors could not be dispensed with. Even the new provisional
regulations have not discarded volley fire, which may<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
be employed by section or by platoon. Fire at will may be
divided into slow fire (one shot from each squad) and lively
fire with counted cartridges.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote153" href="#FNanchor153" class="label">[153]</a> At Nicholson’s Neck (24th Oct., 1899) the British leaders ordered their
men, who were firing at will on the Boers advancing from cover to cover (“<i>Boer
Attack</i>”) to discontinue that fire, and to use volleys only. But the enemy consistently
avoided presenting large targets to the British volley fire.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><i>Germany.</i> <i>Volleys</i> (pars. 106-108 German I. F. R.)
are to be employed by platoons or companies when in close
order; in skirmish line (par. 193 German I. F. R.) only when
the enemy is surprised or the organization is to be kept firmly
in hand. Volleys, however, can be used only when the troops
themselves are not exposed to an effective fire. An organization
will be able to ascertain the range by means of trial volleys
only in exceptional cases.</p>

<p>“<i>The highest attainable rate of fire</i>&mdash;the word rapid fire
has been elided&mdash;is to be used in attack during the preparation
for the assault; in defense to repulse a hostile assault; in
warding off a cavalry charge; in all combat situations in
which a sudden or immediate collision with the enemy occurs;
and, finally, in pursuit.” (Par. 208 German I. F. R.).</p>

<p>“It may be objected that one frequently reads in military history of

<p>“Fire at will was forbidden. Volley fire was used only by direction
of the commanders of the battalion sections of the line. The order to
fire volleys quickly ran along the trenches. For a few minutes a certain
amount of unrest was noticeable among the men, which, if allowed to
continue, might have degenerated into confusion and later perhaps into
disorderly flight.</p>

<p>“The first volley was not quite successful. It was ragged&mdash;some men
even firing a second time without waiting for the command, an example
likely to be followed by the others. The force was on the point of
getting out of hand. Volleys fired by neighboring sections drowned the
voice of the commander. In such situations only personal experience and
resourcefulness can tell a company commander what to do. We recommend<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
a course which has always been attended with success in practice.
Let the officer commanding a section jump upon the parapet and from
there give the order ‘cease firing.’ Then, if the enemy’s fire permits,
and his own heart is stout enough, let him order the next volley from
his position on the parapet. When once the force is again under control,
the volleys will be as good as if the enemy were not so close.”

<p>In his <cite>Comments on Drill Regulations</cite> (16th Nov., 1840) Prince
<span class="smcap">William</span>, subsequently Emperor <span class="smcap">William I.</span> of Germany, says:</p>

<p>“I am personally opposed to volleys by battalion. I am of the opinion
that in war volleys and file fire will seldom be used. Should this fire
be used, however, no one will be able to stop file firing after volley firing,
even though not ordered, <i>because in my opinion it is impossible to combat
human nature</i>, which finds more security in rapid loading and firing
than in awaiting the commands....”</p>

<p><i>Russian experiences in Manchuria.</i> “At first <i>volleys</i> by formed bodies
of troops were attempted, but later fire at will was used. In the latter,
the men were forbidden to hurry, were instructed to bring their pieces
down to the ‘ready,’ and, whenever it was possible to see the enemy&mdash;who
was advancing by rushes&mdash;to change their rear sight elevations at the
whistle signal of their commander.... When at a distance from
the enemy the men remained cool and fired faultless volleys. When the
enemy came closer the volleys deteriorated. The Russians used only fire
at will at ranges under 800 paces. This enabled the men to fire on individual
hostile skirmishers and to place the boldest out of action.” <span class="smcap">Soloviev</span>.</p>

<p><b>Austria.</b> <i>Volleys</i> are employed, as a rule, only by bodies in close
order, for the purpose of finding the range, and for firing upon targets
which appear suddenly at long range and which will probably be visible
for only a short time. Fire at will is the principal kind of fire used, the
rate of fire being increased or decreased by the men according to the
existing situation. When necessary, the leaders should regulate the fire;
but this should only be done in exceptional cases as the men are apt to
increase rather than diminish the rate of fire (“Rapid fire”).</p>

<p>The <i>maximum rate of fire</i> is to be employed: “In <i>attack</i>, for the
purpose of gaining a superiority of fire at short range; in <i>defense</i>, for
the purpose of warding off an impending assault. It is moreover to be
used to inflict the greatest possible losses on a defeated enemy as long
as he is within effective range; and, finally, in fire surprises, repulse of
cavalry attacks, and in rencontres with the enemy.”</p>

<p><b>France.</b> The French <i>Lebel</i> rifle has a cylindrical magazine situated
under the stock and has a capacity of eight cartridges which have to be
loaded singly. As a rule, <i>fire with counted cartridges</i> is employed (<i>feu à
cartouches comptées</i>) for the purpose of obtaining a “burst of fire”
(<i>rafale</i>). The <i>rafale</i>
consists of firmly controlled, concentrated, collective<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
fire. Fire at will (<i>feu à volonté</i>) is also used, eight rounds per minute
being fired at the short ranges. The rapidity of this fire at will may be
increased up to 12 rounds per minute by employing the cartridges in the
magazine (<i>feu à répétition</i>). One minute is required to fill the magazine.
Volleys are to be employed in night combats and when it becomes necessary
to control the men. In exceptional cases individual men are directed
to fire.</p>

<h5>The Rate of Fire.</h5>

<p>As regards its rate, fire may be divided into three classes,
viz., <i>slow fire</i>, <i>accelerated fire</i>, and <i>rapid fire</i>. The command
“fire more slowly” (or more rapidly) serves only the purpose
of diminishing (or increasing) the rate of fire.</p>

<p>The rate of fire depends upon the purpose of action, the
character of the target, and the available ammunition. Unfavorable
illumination and the difficulty of clearly distinguishing
the target at long ranges will reduce the rate of fire. The
aiming position (<i>i.e.</i>, whether the rifle is fired from a prone
position or from a rest) also affects the rate of fire. A well
trained company at peace strength will, moreover, be able to
fire more rapidly than one on a war footing.</p>

<p>Hurried firing should unquestionably be condemned. The
rapidity with which our rifles can be loaded enables us to produce
the maximum fire effect in the minimum time against
narrow targets. <i>The desire of the soldier to make every shot
a hit, carefully inculcated in time of peace, will of itself regulate
the rate of fire.</i> As the rate of fire depends upon the distinctness
with which the target can be seen, it will naturally
increase as the range decreases, thus generally corresponding
to the requirements of the tactical situation. Moreover, as
it is easier to aim at tall targets than at head targets, this also
exercises either an accelerating or a retarding effect, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
case may be. Lieutenant-General Rohne has done a great deal
to bring about a correct appreciation of the rate of fire. He
states: “The opposition to an increased rate of fire is perhaps
due to the belief that it is invariably coupled with a reduction
in accuracy. This is not the case, however, and even if it
were true to a certain extent, it need not necessarily be harmful.
To be sure, when a high rate of fire is solely due to the
excitement of the skirmishers, it is unquestionably to be condemned
because no attempt is made at aiming; but when it is
the product of systematic peace training, it need not necessarily
preclude good aiming. It is entirely consistent with a
high rate of fire to load and point quickly, to keep the target
constantly in view, and, at the same time, to aim accurately
and to pull the trigger without flinching.</p>

<p>“The leader who reduces the rapidity of fire in battle
in order to save ammunition, wastes lives and time,
both more valuable than ammunition. Disabled soldiers are
more difficult to replace than ammunition, and lost time cannot
be replaced at all.”<a id="FNanchor155" href="#Footnote155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A high rate of fire need by no means be synonymous with
waste of ammunition. Ammunition would unquestionably be
wasted if fire were delivered for hours at the same high rate.
It is very probable, however, that in the battles of the future
the fire will be moderate for some time, or, better still, cease
entirely, only to break forth like a thunderstorm over the
enemy when opportunity offers or necessity demands. The
slower the troops fire the longer they will present a target to
the enemy. The coolness shown in firing individual shots at
the commencement of an action will disappear owing to the
impression produced by losses. This is apparent even in field
firing. Lieutenant-General Rohne arrives at the following
average results:</p>

<p>Troops going into action for the first time are inclined to
fire entirely too fast, due to their desire to overcome their
nervousness. Veteran troops seek to attain the same result,
not through rapidity of fire, but through accuracy. Only the
determination to make hits is calculated to overcome nervousness.
Wherever this determination is lacking, wild firing (fire
panic), which is in any case difficult to prevent, will surely result.
Fire delivered hurriedly during unexpected rencontres is
almost invariably ineffective.<a id="FNanchor156" href="#Footnote156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> For this reason most of the

<p>1. <i>When the appropriate elevation is used</i>, two-thirds

of 12-14 rounds per minute.</p>

hits will be greater in animated fire at will than in slow fire;
but in the latter the percentage of hits will be higher.</p>

<p>Of all the different kinds of fire, the <i>volley</i> is best adapted
to meet the requirement of keeping the troops in hand, of concentrating
the fire, and thereby producing great moral effect.
Volleys are of value to troops in ambush, in repulsing cavalry
attacks, and in preventing premature firing against the wishes
of the commander. They should be used against staffs which
would be able to seek cover or spread out when exposed to
fire at will.</p>

<p>As the men are, however, not equally skilled in loading
their pieces, the rate of fire is very little increased by the use
of volleys. The command “Fire” can only be given when the
pieces of the entire unit are directed upon the target. The
length of the pause between preliminary command and command
of execution varies, depending upon the distinctness with
which the target can be seen, the range, and the aiming position.
When the fire is delivered from a prone position it will
be difficult to determine when the command of execution
should properly be given. Moreover, as fire from a standing
or kneeling position will be the exception, this has contributed
to eliminate volley firing on the battlefield, because the troops
lack coolness&mdash;mental as well as physical&mdash;which is indispensable
in every volley.</p>

<p>The material and moral effect of a volley is doubtless
very considerable, but who could possibly make his voice heard
when a deployed platoon of sixty men is firing? How about
the efficacy of the fire when the men revert of their own accord
from volleys to fire at will, which they will do when their<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
officers are either killed or wounded and they themselves are
exposed to fire?<a id="FNanchor158" href="#Footnote158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote158" href="#FNanchor158" class="label">[158]</a> During the advance on Flavigny (Vionville), the support of the 10th
Company, 12th Infantry, was to move into the firing line for the purpose of
firing volleys. “The volley was by no means a good one, however, and the men
at once took up rapid fire. Lieutenant C&mdash;&mdash; jumped in front of the men
to stop the firing, but was shot in the leg and crawled back. The rapid fire
continued along the entire line.” <cite>Geschichte des Regiments, Nr. 12</cite>, p. 454.</p>

<p>During the war between Servia and Bulgaria the Servians always opened
the infantry combat with volleys, but after casualties had occurred among the
officers under the heavy fire of the enemy, the steady volley fire soon degenerated
into wild, hurried fire at will, which produced no effect whatever.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>If we use squad volleys (Russia), we approximate fire at
will without any of its advantages, besides which, commands,
given by so many leaders, tend to confuse the men. Moreover,
it is very difficult to handle the platoon, to stop firing,
to change target, and to initiate movements. Volley firing is
therefore confined to the preparatory stage of combat and to
rare moments in which the troops firing are not themselves
under effective fire. In the defense of fortified positions many
opportunities will be found for the employment of volley fire.
The use of trial volleys for the purpose of testing the rear
sight elevation will be confined to a few favorable cases, and
it may be remarked that animated fire at will concentrated on
some definite point produces the same results.</p>

<p>The French, who retained volleys longer than the other
powers (to keep the men in hand, to regulate the expenditure
of ammunition, and to direct a concentrated collective fire
upon the most important target according to the will of the
leader), found a substitute in the fire with counted cartridges,<a id="FNanchor159" href="#Footnote159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
the “burst of fire” (rafale).<a id="FNanchor160" href="#Footnote160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> This was also adopted by
their artillery. In Germany, the importance of the sudden effect
produced by these “bursts of fire” is recognized, but the
same object is sought to be attained by training alone; while<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
in Russia, fire with counted cartridges has been adopted, not
for the purpose of obtaining rafale fire effect, but for keeping
the men in hand. Rafale fire has the disadvantage that pauses
in the fire are regulated formally, and that these pauses occur
frequently at the very moment when a favorable target is still
visible. Will the individual soldier remain cool in the excitement
of battle and carefully count the three or five cartridges
which he is to fire? In defense, rafale fire is proper, because
the skirmisher in the defensive line is completely hidden during
the pauses, while the attacker presents favorable targets
only temporarily, thus justifying an increased expenditure of
ammunition. In attack, suitable targets are rarely available
for rafale fire, and a substitute for this fire must be sought in
well directed, steadily delivered fire at will, interrupted by
rushes to the front. During an attack, rafale fire might degenerate
into wild, uncontrolled fire at will, the rapidity of
which decreases only when the ammunition runs short. The
employment of this class of fire might sometimes be advisable
in action when it becomes necessary to hold the enemy, that
is, in defensive situations. In this connection, one who is
thoroughly familiar with the French army aptly says: “Rafale
fire may be likened to the wild passes made by a man, backed
up against a wall, for the purpose of warding off an adversary
who is able to decide the controversy with one well-aimed
blow.”</p>

Par. 194.1 of the <cite>French Infantry Drill Regulations</cite> of Dec. 3rd, 1904,
states: “The moral effect produced upon an opponent by the fire is much more
considerable when the fire is concentrated and delivered suddenly and unexpectedly.”
Par. 194.4 states: “The efficacy of the fire, due to its intensity, is
augmented when the enemy is taken by surprise,” etc. Par. 195.1 states: “The
fire is, as a rule, delivered by ‘rafales,’ which are short, sudden and violent; and,
in exceptional cases, by volleys.”</p>

<h4>9. REAR SIGHT ELEVATIONS AND POINTS OF AIM.</h4>

<p>In Switzerland and Italy the employment of a single rear
sight elevation, less than the actual range, is preferred, even
when the range is not accurately known. The French regulations
are silent on this subject. In Germany one rear sight
elevation is used, as a general rule, up to 1,000 m.; beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span>
that range combined sights may be used in which the two rear
sight elevations differ from each other by 100 or 50 m.<a id="FNanchor161" href="#Footnote161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote161" href="#FNanchor161" class="label">[161]</a>
See <span class="smcap">Rohne</span>, <cite>Schieszlehre
für die Infanterie</cite>, p. 93, et seq.</p>

<p>In view of the greater dispersion of fire in action, the author recommends
the selection of either one elevation only, or, at the longer ranges, the employment
of combined sights, in which the elevations differ from each other by
200 m. In peace time the use of combined sights, by well-trained marksmen, in
which rear sight elevations differ by only 50 m. would, indeed, be sufficient to
increase the number of hits, but on the battlefield the favorable conditions found
on the target range are lacking.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“Rapidly approaching or receding targets are followed by
making proper sight corrections, rear sight elevations being
less than the range when the fire is delivered against advancing
targets and greater than the range when the fire is delivered
against receding targets. At short ranges the same result
may be obtained by aiming lower or higher. It should be
noted that, when firing on cavalry making a mounted attack,
the danger space is continuous when the sights are raised to
700 m.” (Par. 192 German I. F. R.). As a general rule, the
proper aiming point is the lowest line of the target. When
it becomes necessary to aim at the center, to one side of or
below a target, its dimensions will serve as a guide. A change
in the rear sight elevation is necessary at medium and long
ranges to raise or lower the sheaf of fire; at short ranges it is
practicable to point higher only when the target is tall. When
the velocity of a side wind cannot be estimated, it is advisable
to distribute the fire over a broader front. At short ranges
the selection of an aiming point may, under favorable circumstances,
be left to the discretion of the individual skirmishers.</p>

<h4>10. COMMANDS.</h4>

<p>In recounting the several commands to be given for firing,
the regulations take into consideration the logical sequence of
the tasks devolving upon the skirmisher. Thus the first command
draws the skirmisher’s attention to the target; the second
indicates the range; the third directs him to open fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span></p>

<h4>11. THE OBSERVATION OF THE FIRE.</h4>

<p>The actions of the enemy are usually the only reliable indication
of the location of the sheaf of fire directed against
him; the observed strike of bullets is seldom so good an indication.
It is especially difficult to judge of the distribution
of projectiles from their strike in front and in rear of the target.
Suggestions from the subordinate leaders, whose view
of the target is generally restricted, are often more confusing
than valuable.</p>

<h4>12. THE EFFECT OF FIRE.</h4>

<h5>COMPARISON BETWEEN LOSSES PRODUCED BY INFANTRY AND
ARTILLERY FIRE.</h5>

<p>In 1866 the Austrian artillery inflicted 16% of our losses.
In 1870-71 the French artillery inflicted 8% of our losses.
Up to the battle of Liao Yang the 1st Japanese Army suffered

a standard of comparison by means of which tactical
success may be measured, and aids in deciding how to distribute
the fire. Differences in fire effect on like targets are best
determined by comparing the number of figures hit per minute
by 100 marksmen, as a great number of hits is presupposed,
which is not the case when the percentage of hits is
taken.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote162" href="#FNanchor162" class="label">[162]</a>
In this connection the following works have been consulted: <cite>Das Gefechtsmäszige
Abteilungsschieszen der Infanterie</cite>, 4th Edition (1905), by Lieutenant-General
<span class="smcap">Rohne</span>, and
<cite>Schieszlehre für die Infanterie</cite>, 2nd Edition (1906), by the
same author; also <cite>Militär-Wochenblatt</cite> No. 46 of 1900. To be sure, absolute
trustworthiness cannot be claimed for the figures given, for the conditions of
firing in action are variable; but, as obtained by Lieutenant-General Rohne, they
serve as an excellent standard of comparison, and, when their relative value is
considered, as a basis for tactical deductions.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h5>(a) Influence of Training.</h5>

<p>Individual skill in marksmanship is of decisive importance
when firing at targets of appropriate size at the short ranges.
A good marksman, firing at will, may (not <i>must</i>) expect a
hit from each round fired, at any target within 250 m., at a
single kneeling opponent within 350 m., at a kneeling file
within 500 m., and at a standing file within 600 m. At ranges
beyond this, influences, due to the imperfections of the rifle,
make themselves felt; and these influences grow to such an
extent that the best marksmanship training is unable to eliminate
them. A considerable number of rifles must fire in order
to produce an effect; for, as some of the pieces fire short<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
and others over, the hits are thus distributed over a greater
area. But even here skill in marksmanship is apparent in that
the cone of dispersion of the excellent shots produces a shot
group of small diameter, that of the poorer shots one of
very large diameter. Lieutenant-General Rohne computed
(<cite>Schieszlehre für die Infanterie</cite>, p. 84) that when firing rifle
model ’98 with the appropriate elevation at a target 1 m. high,
the marksmen named in the following table would obtain the
number of hits given at the ranges indicated:</p>

<table class="dontwrap fsize90" summary="Rifle hits">

<tr class="btd bb">
<th rowspan="3" class="br">Range.</th>
<th colspan="3"><span class="smcap">Number of Hits Obtained by</span></th>
</tr>

<tr class="bb">
<th class="padl1 padr1 br">Excellent<br />shots</th>
<th class="padl1 padr1 br">Fair shots</th>
<th class="padl1 padr1">Poor shots</th>

<tr class="bb">
<td class="left padr2 br">1500 m.</td>
<td class="center br">14.2</td>
<td class="center br">&#8199;9.7</td>
<td class="center">4.8</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>This ratio changes, however, very seriously to the disadvantage
of the excellent marksmen when the appropriate elevation
is not used. The <a href="#Ref1">figure</a> given below, in which the
curves of hits are traced, shows that even poor shots may obtain
better results in this case.</p>

<p>From this may be deduced the great importance of quickly
and accurately ascertaining the range. The excellent ballistic
qualities of our rifle and our thorough marksmanship training
can assert themselves fully only when the range has been
accurately determined. At ranges over 800 m. too great an accuracy
in collective fire may be actually detrimental. In this
case individual accuracy matters little; the important thing is
to direct the densest portion of the sheaf of fire, with some
degree of accuracy, on a target the range to which is known
only in a general way. The importance of training soldiers
in precise marksmanship is ethical rather than practical, for
a good target shot need not necessarily be a battle marksman.
For the latter a cool head is of more value than all the marksmanship
skill of the target range.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span></p>

<h5>(b) Influence of the Error in Estimating the Range.</h5>

<p>At short ranges an error of estimation is offset by the
flatness of the trajectory. Lieutenant-General Rohne used a
probable error in estimation of <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>8</sub> (12.5%) of the range in
his computations. The Swiss Firing Regulations of 1905
count on an error of 100 m. at 500 m., 200 m. at 500 to 1,000
m., 300 m. at ranges over 1,000 m., and the average is taken to
be <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>5</sub> of the range, or 20%. For measurements with range
finding instruments see <a href="#Page146">p. 146</a>, supra.</p>

<h5>(c) Fire Effect as Regards Time. Number of Rounds
to be Expended.</h5>

<p>The greater the losses inflicted within a short period of
time in a limited space, the greater the moral effect of the fire.
It should therefore be the aim of the officer charged with fire
direction to bring about a decisive effect within the shortest
possible time. The leaders must bear in mind from the beginning
of the fire fight that the ammunition carried is limited
and that the expenditure of a certain amount is equivalent to
a loss of power, and this is permissible only where commensurate
results would be achieved. When once a decision
has been formed to fire on a target, the ammunition necessary
to accomplish the object of the fight must be expended without
stinting, since ineffective fire impairs the morale of one’s own
troops and raises that of the enemy.</p>

<p>When the enemy is approximately equal to us in numbers,
and is deployed in line at one man per meter of front, presenting
breast targets only, the number of rounds per rifle, given
in round figures in the following table, will be required to
place about one-third of the enemy’s force out of action:<a id="FNanchor163" href="#Footnote163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>In the above table it is assumed that an error of estimation
of 7.5% was made and that at ranges over 1000 m. two
elevations were used. Against head targets, approximately
twice the number of rounds indicated above must be expended;
and against exposed skirmishers, visible at full height, about
half of the number of rounds given. The efficacy is increased
when the fire comes from a flank. The following data are
taken from an extended firing test: At 600-700 m., 200 skirmishers,
firing 5000 rounds against 200 body targets, obtained
4.3% hits and placed 43% of the figures out of action; under
the enfilading fire delivered by one platoon, the percentage of
hits rose to 10.5%, and the number of incapacitated figures
to 80%.</p>

<h5>(d) Additional Influences Affecting Accuracy of Fire.</h5>

<p>Errors in setting the sight, in pointing, aiming, and pulling
the trigger, increase the area of the beaten zone at the expense
of fire effect on the actual target selected. When we
consider the excitement of men in action, and the numerous
sources of error in setting the sights, in pointing and firing, it
is clear that we have to reckon with the <b>effect of misses</b> on
the field of battle more than with the really well aimed and
well delivered collective fire of a considerable number of marksmen.
Lieutenant Colonel Wolozkoi, late of the Russian
Army,<a id="FNanchor164" href="#Footnote164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> attempted to obtain an approximate standard of measurement
for the errors in firing made by marksmen. He bases
his deductions upon the opinion that the efficacy of rifle fire in
action depends entirely upon the mental and physical condition
of the individual soldier at the moment; that in serious
engagements this condition is such that accurate aiming cannot
be expected; and finally that every skirmisher, according
to the degree of his excitement or fatigue, will fire his piece
at varying angles of elevation. He argues that this produces
a rigid cone of dispersion, whose limits correspond to certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span>
extreme angles of error, and whose axis (center trajectory)
corresponds to a mean angle of error; that, for each class of
rifles, the depth of the resulting beaten zone is constant; and
that the depth of this zone increases with the range corresponding
to the angles of error. It follows that the depth of
this beaten zone is greater in modern rifles than in those of
older pattern.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote164" href="#FNanchor164" class="label">[164]</a> <cite>Das Gewehrfeuer im Gefecht</cite>, 1883.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>He believes that peace training will have fulfilled its mission
if the skirmisher, while firing, holds his piece in the position
to which he has become habituated through years of practice.
This position can be none other than that in which the
piece is horizontal.</p>

<p>Although the theory of the <b>Rigid, Constant Cone of
Misses</b>, is not tenable in this form, because there will always
be a reasonably compact core of hits (the dimensions of which
depend upon the conditions indicated in the firing regulations)
at the center of the cone of fire, the views of Colonel Wolozkoi
have, nevertheless, a certain value for us, and find application
in large, hotly contested battles, especially when the firing line
has been exposed to the material and moral influences of hostile
fire for a considerable length of time. At the commencement
of every combat we can, at any rate, count on “aimed fire”;
but instead of reckoning at all times with a 75% core of hits,
100 m. in diameter, we must become used to reckoning with
a 30 and 40% core of hits, of the same diameter, produced by
greater dispersion of the bullets.</p>

<p>According to experiments made by Colonel Wolozkoi, a
good shot makes a mean angular error of ±8 minutes, when
using the horizontal aiming position; a poor shot, one of ±40
minutes; the average error being ±25 minutes. In this, however,
the sources of error, due to excitement on the part of
the marksmen, are not considered. “The principal angular
errors can be traced to the nervousness of the marksmen; and
this is directly proportional to the magnitude of the danger<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
and the suddenness of its appearance. The soldier judges the
magnitude of danger by the number of hostile projectiles and
by their effect. Therefore, the livelier the hostile fire, and the
longer it continues, the greater the danger appears to him;
while the less the effect of that fire, and the better he is sheltered
from it, the less he will think himself endangered. On
this account, the nervous tension of the individual soldier will
reach different degrees of intensity according to the magnitude
of the danger.</p>

<p>“Now there are combat situations where the danger is insignificant,
and entire engagements in which the impression
produced by danger may be called moderate; moreover, even
in lively actions phases may occur in which this is equally true.
The circumstances of each particular case will, therefore, determine
how long it is possible to fire as prescribed in the firing
regulations, and from what moment a reduction of efficacy,
according to Colonel Wolozkoi’s theory, is unavoidable.</p>

<p>“The arrival of this moment will be postponed more or
less by better discipline and training; and, in addition, at the
commencement of an action, we may count on the men putting
into practice, to a certain extent, what they have been taught
in time of peace. However, the efficacy of rifle fire will deteriorate
gradually, as the danger and the intensity of the fight
increase, until it reaches the stage which Wolozkoi considers
peculiar to all of the more serious actions.</p>

<p>“When discipline is still further reduced, the efforts of
the men to keep under cover may lead them to duck even
their heads and to fire their rifles at high angles. In this case
the decisive short ranges would not be swept by fire, making
it possible for the more determined of the two opponents to
advance to the assault.</p>

<p>“This reduction of the efficacy of fire (<i>i.e.</i>, the delivery
of fire at high angles) may also take place when troops are
surprised and, in consequence thereof, fire hurriedly. This explains<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
why the enemy’s fire passes entirely over a body of
troops which has gotten quite close to his position&mdash;by no
means an unusual phenomenon in surprises.”<a id="FNanchor165" href="#Footnote165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Wolozkoi assumes that the core of hits of his constant
cone is formed by projectiles fired at a mean angle of departure
of less than 4 degrees, while the lower trajectories of
the whole cone of fire correspond to an angle of 1 degree and
30 minutes, and the upper trajectories to one of 14 degrees
and 30 minutes. If we apply these figures to a particular rifle
we obtain a beaten zone containing 50% of the hits (central
zone) at 560-1500 m. for the <i>Chassepot</i> rifle; at 1000-2000
m. for the 8 mm. rifle, and at 1200-3000 m. for the 6.5 mm.
rifle. It should once more be emphasized that these figures are
applicable in combat phases in which the men themselves are
under fire, while firing, or deliver their fire hurriedly or with
bad aim.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>During the <b>Franco-German war</b> the German troops learned by experience
that the defender’s fire inflicted serious losses on the attacker
at long ranges, but that the efficacy of his fire did not increase as the
skirmishers came closer to his position; that, on the contrary, the intensity
of the hostile fire effect fell off noticeably at ranges below 600 m.</p>

<p>During the attack made by the Prussian Guard against <b>St. Privat</b>,
the greatest number of dead and wounded were counted at ranges from
1200-1500 m., and the fewest losses were sustained at ranges from 500-600
m. from the enemy’s position, where it had to remain stationary on
the slope for about an hour awaiting the effect of the enveloping movement
made by the Saxon Army Corps. A range of 1500 m. corresponds
approximately to an angle of departure of 5 degrees for the <i>Chassepot</i> rifle.
The 20th Infantry Division was molested by rifle fire from <b>St. Privat</b>,
during its march from <b>St. Ail</b> to <b>St. Privat</b> (the range in this case was
2200 m., which corresponds to an angle of departure of 15 degrees 30
minutes for the <i>Chassepot</i> rifle) although the skirmishers of the Guard,
against whom this fire was directed, were only from 400 to 500 m. from
the French position.</p>

<p>In the <b>Russo-Turkish war</b> of 1877-78, the same thing occurred. Infantry
projectiles reached the Russian reserves while they were still
2500 m. from the enemy (this range corresponds to an angle of departure
of 14 degrees 30 minutes).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span></p>

<p>Kuropatkin corroborates the statement that at 1500 m. and beyond
(5 degrees 50 minutes), the losses produced by the Turkish rifle fire were
very serious; that at 400 m. (1 degree 8 minutes) from the hostile position,
on the other hand, the losses were remarkably small, sometimes even
ceasing entirely. The Turks finally kept their heads under cover altogether.</p>

<p>A correspondent writes the following in regard to the engagement at
<b>Slivnica</b> on November 17th to 19th, 1885: “When at 400 m. from the
enemy, the firing lines suffered scarcely any losses, while the reserves,
stationed far to the rear, suffered severely from stray shots.”</p>

<p>It must be the endeavor of peace training to prevent the
occurrence of unaimed firing in battle. This necessitates careful
supervision by squad and platoon leaders over the individual
soldier in the firing line, and the severe punishment of
every act of carelessness in pointing, aiming, and setting of
the sight, in peace time. In war one must constantly endeavor
to avoid opening fire prematurely, as it tires the eye and the
arm of the soldier, to check any unjustifiable rapidity of fire,
and to hold the men down to a steady and slow fire. This includes,
in addition, the avoidance, by the leader, of haste in
giving directions for firing. In defense, one will have to make
every effort to withdraw one’s men from the moral effect of
the attacker’s fire preparation, and to keep them in proper condition
to repulse the assault. This requires the construction
of splinter proofs, head cover, and, in case the hostile fire
becomes too deadly, a cessation of fire, which is again resumed
when the enemy attempts to advance. To carry this out
properly, covered observation stations should be built, and the
men instructed to line the parapet and to open fire at a signal
previously agreed upon, sights having been set and ammunition
replenished before they leave cover. A body of troops is
not unfit to resist an assault simply because it has suffered a
certain percentage of losses, but because each individual soldier
is so mastered by the feeling that he is in danger of losing his
life that he fires his piece without raising his head above the
parapet. A body of troops in such a state will fire its projectiles
in Wolozkoi’s “constant cone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span></p>

<p>A mobilized organization, thoroughly trained in time of
peace, will still fire a by no means inconsiderable fraction of
its projectiles with good aim and with the proper rear sight
elevation, provided its officers are equal to their task.</p>

<h5>(e) The Influence of Rifle-Rests in Firing.</h5>

<p>Freehand firing increases the rate of fire. Whether the
skirmisher fires freehand or from a rest is of influence on the
accuracy of the single shot at short ranges. The Belgian,
Dutch, and Italian regulations authorize the bayonet, in the
absence of other expedients, to be stuck into the ground as a
rifle-rest, while this is forbidden in Germany. Collective fire
of short duration delivered at mid ranges has not been found
superior because of the use of rifle-rests. Fire delivered from
a rest is undoubtedly superior, however, when the barrel of the
piece is heated by continued firing (position of the left hand
supporting the piece when firing standing, prone, or kneeling)
and when the arm of the skirmisher gets tired. When firing
from a rest, high shots result from vibrations of the barrel;<a id="FNanchor166" href="#Footnote166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
and there is also danger, when under fire, that the men will
not raise their heads over the parapet, but will fire their
pieces into the air. This, as corroborated by the more recent
campaigns, is why a fire fight at short range is by no means
decided in so short a time as the peace performances of modern
rifles lead one to suppose, for great losses do not take place
until skirmishers, who have heretofore hugged the ground,
rise. At Spionskop, the two opposing firing lines remained
stationary for hours at 250 m. from each other.<a id="FNanchor167" href="#Footnote167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
The<span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span>
Japanese found in their attacks that at ranges from 150 to 75
paces the hostile fire had no effect.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote166" href="#FNanchor166" class="label">[166]</a>

The British Infantry (consisting of 2694 men, exclusive of subsequent
reinforcements), which was engaged at short range on Spionskop from 3 A. M.
until 9:30 P. M., lost 40 officers and 721 men in 18<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> hours (one officer to every
18.5 men), <i>i.e.</i>, 28.2%. See <a href="#Page189">p. 189</a> infra.</p>

<p>So far we have considered only the effect of infantry fire
on level ground. The efficacy of fire is, however, greatly influenced
by the inclination of the ground upon which the cone
of dispersion falls. Where the ground rises in respect to the
line of sight, the depth of the beaten zone is decreased; where
it falls in respect to the line of sight, the depth of the beaten
zone is increased.<a id="FNanchor169" href="#Footnote169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote169" href="#FNanchor169" class="label">[169]</a>
Lieutenant-General <span class="smcap">Rohne’s</span> definitions are given below in explanation of
certain technical terms:</p>

<p>“<i>Danger Space</i>” is the distance measured along the line of sight within
which the trajectory neither rises above the height of the target nor falls
below the target.</p>

<p>“<i>Beaten Zone</i>” is the distance measured along the surface of the ground
within which the trajectory does not rise above the height of the target.</p>

<p>Whether a target will be struck by a bullet when the range has not been
correctly estimated depends entirely upon the danger space. In pointing at the
bottom line of the target, the aiming position (<i>i.e.</i>, the height at which the
piece is held) does not affect the danger space. When pointing at the center
of the target the danger space changes, increasing for low rear sight elevations
and tall targets, and decreasing for high rear sight elevations and low targets,
as compared with aim taken at the bottom line of a target. “The evil effects
of errors in estimating the range decrease as the ‘danger space’ increases,
which, by the way, is wholly dependent upon the ballistic properties of the rifle,
upon the range, and the height of the target. The danger on the ground in
rear of the target fired upon, and the difficulty of bringing up reinforcements
and ammunition over it, increases directly as the beaten zone, which in addition
depends upon the inclination of the ground to the line of sight.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>The importance of this circumstance is frequently so magnified in the
French infantry that sight is lost of tactical requirements. For example,
they employ formulae to ascertain the point from which a height can be
covered with grazing fire, or propose to defend the ascent to a plateau by
evacuating the military crest and occupying the reverse slope, keeping the
slope facing the enemy under a grazing fire with the tail ends of the
trajectories.</p>

<p>Let A B B¹, in the accompanying <a href="#Ref2">figure</a>, represent a horizontal
plane pierced by trajectories C B and C¹ B¹, at an angle
α, forming the beaten zone B B¹. If now the ground falls
from B in the direction B D, it is obvious from the <a href="#Ref2">figure</a>,
that the angle of fall β decreases and the beaten zone
B D increases. The limit of this increase is reached when the
angle of slope is greater than the angle of fall of the projectile.
In this case there is a dead angle beyond B and toward D. If, on
the other hand, the ground be rising, the angle of fall will be
C¹ D¹ B and the beaten zone<a id="FNanchor170" href="#Footnote170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> decreases to B D¹. The smaller
the angle of fall of the projectile the greater the influence of
the ground.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote170" href="#FNanchor170" class="label">[170]</a>
The computation of beaten zones is based upon the formula deduced by
Lieutenant-General <span class="smcap">Rohne</span>
in his work <cite>Schieszlehre für Infanterie</cite>, p. 127:</p>

<p class="noindent highline15">Let<br />
<span class="padl4">α = angle of fall;</span><br />
<span class="padl4">γ = angle of slope (rising or falling);</span><br />
<span class="padl4">β = beaten zone on level ground;</span><br />
then<br />
<span class="padl4"><span class="horsplit"><span class="top">α</span>

<span class="padl4"><span class="horsplit"><span class="top">α</span>
<span class="bot">α + γ</span></span> β = beaten zone on rising ground.</span></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>From this it follows that when fire direction is in competent
hands the appearance of the enemy on the terrain as at
B D will be fully taken advantage of, while firing on slope
like B D¹ should be avoided. Troops will, however, rarely
be in a position from which they can see a target on the slope
B D. The efficacy of the fire will in such a case be more or less<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
a matter of accident. A body of troops in broad formation
will in this case receive a greater number of hits than a column,
since each meter of front of the crest line receives a certain
number of projectiles. It is otherwise, however, where the
slope rises in respect to the line of sight. A line is more easily
missed than a column of considerable depth on the march.</p>

<p>The above <a href="#Ref3">figure</a>, taken from Lieutenant-General <span class="smcap">Rohne’s</span> work,
<cite>Schieszlehre für die Infanterie</cite>, p. 128, shows the influence of the ground
on the efficacy of fire when “poor” shots are firing at a target, 100, 200 m.
etc., in rear of which are other targets of the same dimensions but situated
either on level ground, on a 2-degree rising slope, or a 1-degree falling
slope. On a rising slope of 2 degrees the depth of the beaten zone is
decreased by half, and on a downward slope of 1 degree increased by half.</p>

<p>“The knowledge of this influence of the ground is of great importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
to the tactician. For this reason I have selected ‘poor’ shots for
the above example because the efficacy of infantry fire in battle will approximate
theirs more nearly than any other. From this we may deduce
that where the ground slopes upward in rear of a firing line, less distance
will suffice to withdraw supports from the fire directed at the firing
line than on level ground; and that, if the ground in rear of the firing
line slopes downward, the distances must be increased unless the slope
is so great or the hostile trajectories so flat that bullets pass over the
crest, forming a ‘defiladed space,’ into which no projectiles strike.”</p>

<p>On ground rising in respect to the line of sight (<i>i.e.</i>, on the slope
of heights facing the enemy, or opposite to commanding ground, the
slope facing the plain) columns suffer the greatest losses; on ground
falling in respect to the line of sight (on the reverse slope of hills and on

<p>Where the ground falls at a greater angle than the angle of fall of
the projectiles (about 5 degrees at 1500 m., and 1 degree at 800 m.) a
defiladed space is formed, which makes it possible to bring supports nearer
to the firing line than would be practicable on level ground. If we assume
that each graduation of the rear sight over 600 m. commands a space
100 m. deep with the normal core of hits, we obtain the following depths
of the beaten zones at a range of 1500 m., with rifle model ’98 (angle
of fall 5 degrees and 22 minutes):</p>

<p>The figures on <a href="#Page181">pages 181</a> and <a href="#Page182">182</a> show to what extent the ground is
capable of increasing or diminishing the efficacy of fire. The French assert
that the Würtembergers deliberately applied these principles in the defense
of the park wall at <b>Villiers</b>. It was, at any rate, only an accident that the
masses of troops on the west side of the gently sloping Mamelon de
Villiers suffered heavy losses on November 30th, 1870.</p>

<p>General <span class="smcap">Paquié</span>
of the French Army<a id="FNanchor171" href="#Footnote171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> lays down the following rule:
“When the angle of slope of falling ground corresponds to the angle of
fall of the lowest trajectory of a cone of dispersion, the depth of the
beaten zone will be 2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> times greater than on level ground. When the
angle of slope of falling ground is equal to the angle of fall of the mean
trajectory of a cone of dispersion, the depth of the beaten zone will be
2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> times greater than on level ground. When the lowest trajectory of
a cone of dispersion passes over the crest of a hill at the height of a man,
and when the reverse slope of that hill is equal to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>100</sub> of the range, the
depth of the beaten zone will be five times as great as on level ground.”</p>

<p>These data are of no practical value in war. They serve only to
increase the appreciation of fire effect when examining the terrain, and
train the eye in judging such situations.</p>

<p>The character of the ground may exert great influence when firing
on intrenchments. Fire delivered from low ground against an enemy in
shelter-trenches is absolutely ineffective&mdash;as shown in the action against
the French IInd Corps at <b>Point du Jour</b> and by the experiences of the
Russians at <b>Plevna</b> and <b>Gorni Dubniac</b>. This condition becomes aggravated
the smaller the angles of fall of the projectiles, and the higher the
target is situated relative to the firing position of the attacking party.</p>

<p>Attacks on hill positions show that there is a range at which the
greatest efficacy may be obtained from fire directed against the top of the
height itself. This maximum efficacy gradually dwindles as the position is
approached. This fact has led the Swiss to retain a <i>Main Firing Position</i>.
(See Figure, <a href="#Page182">p. 182</a>. Fire effect from A and from B). For the purpose
of determining the favorable range, “D,” corresponding to a certain height
(of the enemy’s position) “H,” Lieutenant-General <span class="smcap">Rohne</span> has deduced
the following formula for rifle model ’88:<a id="FNanchor172" href="#Footnote172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>The well-known plateau of the “Galgenhügel” at Wörth, which is at present
crowned by the monument of the 50th Infantry (elevation 35 m.) could be
effectively swept by the fire of our present-day weapons at 1025 m.; a further
advance would reduce the fire effect. For rifle model ’98 the formula might be
stated: 20.H + 600.</p>

<p>It is only in fortress warfare that it might occasionally be possible
to apply this formula. To determine at what distance the defender must
take position in rear of a crest, in order to sweep the slope facing the
enemy with his fire (aiming points being resorted to) without being himself
exposed to view, is of still less value for use in the field. According
to General Warnet of the French Army, if “p” is the degree of slope expressed
in centimeters, the defender should choose between two points
which lie between (p + 5) 1000 and (p + 3) 1000. When the degree of
slope is 1 cm. in 10 cm., the defender should take up his position either
600 or 300 m. in rear of the main crest. In such a position the defender
will, it is true, be protected to a certain extent from the enemy’s fire, but
can only very inadequately defend the slope facing the enemy. A concentration
of fire on certain targets is impossible and the attacker is given an
opportunity to reach the crest, here and there, without coming under fire.
Thus ballistic advantages must be given up in the face of the numerous
tactical disadvantages. We have mentioned this subject here, to show the
strange excrescenses which an undeniably sound basic principle may
develop in the hands of theorists, who have entirely forgotten that in war
only that which is simple succeeds.</p>

<p>“Indirect Rifle Fire” is to be used in firing on a target not visible from
the firing position. In this connection, the following is taken from the
report of Captain <span class="smcap">Knobloch</span>,

<p>“Indirect rifle fire is infantry fire in which aiming points are used.
These should lie above and beyond the target and in line with it. It goes
without saying that an aiming point fulfilling all these conditions will
rarely be found. Moreover, the aiming point must not be selected at
random at some particular elevation, because the angle between target and
aiming point, expressed by graduations on the rear sight leaf, might possibly
lead to a negative sight setting.</p>

<p>“In the practical tests made on varied ground against targets of appropriate
height, splendid results were obtained as regards effect; but the
aiming point had to be indicated by means of a flag. Despite the fact that
the terrain was covered with numerous objects, such as trees, woods, factory
chimneys, etc., no suitable aiming point could be found on the terrain
itself. This largely determines the value of indirect rifle fire in the field.”</p>

<p>This class of fire is, however, worth a trial at any rate. Moreover,
its tactical, combined with its moral, advantages are so great that we
could afford to accept calmly a fire effect poorer by comparison. Indirect
rifle fire will, at times, give troops an opportunity to do damage to the
enemy without being themselves seen or fired upon.</p>

<p>It remains to mention briefly the effect of <b>ricochets</b>
which, as a rule, tumble<a id="FNanchor174" href="#Footnote174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> after striking. Their range upon
rebounding is short. Bullets ricochet most frequently on
water, on rocky and hard ground, more rarely on wet meadows,
and on tilled soil, but they do not ricochet at all on sandy soil.
Ploughed fields, in which the furrows run obliquely to the line
of fire, eliminate the effect of ricochets almost entirely. When
jacketed bullets (but not the massive French “D” projectiles)
strike upon rocky ground, they have a tendency to alter their
form materially, or to tear the jacket, thereby considerably
increasing the severity of the wound which is produced. The
range of ricochets upon rebounding depends mainly upon the
angle at which they are deflected. When the lateral deflection
is 30 degrees their range may amount to about 1300 m. The
nearer a bullet strikes to the skirmisher firing it, and the smaller
the angle of deflection of the consequent ricochet, the greater
its range; under favorable conditions this may amount to
2500 m. According to French experiments, in firing at a range
of 800 m., 4% ricochet hits struck a target, the height of a
man, at 1400 m., and 1% ricochet hits a similar target at
1850 m. from the skirmisher who did the firing.</p>

<p>An attempt to move troops in close order formations
within the zone of uninterrupted infantry fire at ranges under
1500 m. when the enemy is still in condition to direct his fire
on them, is bound to lead to losses which make the further
tactical employment of these troops impossible.</p>

<p>Bodies of troops following the firing lines will also have
to deploy when the hostile fire reaches them, unless they can
find cover. It is a disadvantage for them to deploy, and every
opportunity to return to close order formation must be utilized.</p>

<p>Troops in rear, not directly fired upon and exposed only

<p>The company deployed in line of sections in columns of
twos would thus seem to be the most favorable formation for
movements, and the line lying prone is especially well suited
for halts. For movements under purely frontal, concentrated
fire, the line is the least favorable formation, while the route
column offers the narrowest target. In this, the character of
the terrain plays a decisive role. In firing on targets consisting
of columns, it has been assumed that a single projectile will
place only one man out of action. Under shrapnel fire the
formations are similarly arranged as regards their vulnerability,
the line formation being less favorable than the column of
platoons, since the former receives all bullets deflected laterally.</p>

<p>The total losses in battles and more serious engagements
amount to from 10 to 20% of the participating troops. In
some organizations the losses in killed and wounded may
amount to as much as 50-60%. The loss that an organization
will endure is directly proportional to its efficiency. Good
troops, which unexpectedly get into a difficult situation (as,
for example, the British Brigade of Highlanders at Magersfontain),
and which have been trained to look upon heavy
losses as unavoidable, will be capable of enduring a loss of
25% in the course of a battle without going to pieces and without
discontinuing the attack.<a id="FNanchor179" href="#Footnote179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>At the battle of <b>Gravelotte</b>, in which 166,400 rifles, 21,200 sabres, and
732 guns, extending over a front of 19 km., participated on the German
side, only 109,200 rifles and 628 guns fought the decisive action. The
losses amounted to 9.51%, distributed as follows: 899 officers and 19,260
men; according to arms: infantry, 10.96%; cavalry, 0.66%, and artillery,
5.74%. On the decisive flank, the infantry of the Guard suffered a loss of

44%, the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Guard, 55.5% of their
enlisted strength, the 6th Company of the latter regiment losing even 141

<p>The losses among officers are especially heavy. This is
by no means due to the attempt of the hostile skirmishers to
pick off the leaders in the combat at short range, but to the
fact that, in order to lead their men, officers must expose themselves.
This becomes more and more necessary the greater the
moral effect of the combat on the nervous systems of the men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>

<h4>14. THE MORAL EFFECT OF FIRE.</h4>

<p>The moral effect may make itself felt in a two-fold way:
as the sum of the impressions influencing the soldier at all
times in action, and as the momentary general impression produced
by a sudden considerable increase in the losses. The
great material effect of fire creates such a consciousness of
danger in men’s minds that in a defeated force more than half
of its numbers succumb to this moral effect of the fire.</p>

<p>“Troops do not retreat because they are unable to maintain
themselves owing to their numerical inferiority, but because
they fear the losses which they would suffer if they
advanced further. The determination to conquer has been
overcome by the desire to live. The confusion of impressions
increases with the size of the force. Taken individually, the
men might behave quite sensibly, but in a crowd they are
claimed either by insanity or lethargy. The activity of the
mind is completely replaced by imagination; everything is believed;
nothing is appraised; exaggeration prevails everywhere;
and precipitation produces unthought of results. When the
men come to their senses, it is as if they were awakened from
a stupor; they are unable to understand how fear could have
induced them to do the very opposite from that which would,
most surely, have saved them from destruction.”<a id="FNanchor184" href="#Footnote184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of the impressions of the battle of St. Privat,
General von Kessel wrote: “The men appear to be either
extraordinarily excited or stupefied. Their faces are distorted
and only a few still retain firm will power.”</p>

<p>General Bonnal describes his first impressions at the
battle of Wörth as follows: “Since half-past seven our
battalion was lying, facing eastward, in the neighborhood of
the wood of Fröschweiler. The shrieking of the Prussian
shells, but especially the noise of the shells bursting in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
midst of the batteries of the 3rd Division in position in our
rear, made a considerable impression on our men. Their joking
ceased, and nervousness was plainly visible in their pale
faces. Men to whom tobacco was offered declined it; they had
no desire to smoke. All eyes were focused upon the officers.
The latter were congregated here and there in small groups;
a few were trying hard to joke, others were walking up and
down, with a cigarette between their lips, making convulsive
efforts to appear at ease; a small number were entirely calm
as if no danger was present.... The first batch of
wounded made a strong impression. The battalion was to reinforce
the Turcos in the edge of the wood of Fröschweiler.
The fire of the Turcos drowned all other sounds. There was
nothing to indicate that the enemy was also concentrating a
heavy fire upon the wood. We deployed into line to the right.
The deployment began, but scarcely ten men had reached the
edge of the wood when a terrible cracking and rattling commenced.
It was a mitrailleuse battery which fired a volley directly
under our very noses. At this moment our men lost
their heads. They blazed away like mad, crowded in three,
four, and five ranks at the foot of the downward slope. The
men in front had thrown themselves to the ground, the others
fired kneeling or standing, leaning against trees. Since all of
the men fired without aiming, enveloped moreover by a dense,
impenetrable cloud of smoke, the advanced lines were in greater
danger of being hit by French bullets than by those of the
enemy. We had to throw ourselves to the ground to avoid
being shot down by the lines in rear. On the hill opposite to
us, at a range of 300 to 400 m., there rested a white smoke
cloud, and we could indistinctly discern the enemy, who was
keeping up a lively fire. The powder smoke enveloping us
was so dense that we literally could not breathe.” This excitement
gradually subsided and the leaders were able to get
the troops again under control.</p>

<p>The numerous surrenders of British troops in the engagements
of the Boer War were due to the peculiar conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
existing in the theater of war. Besides, Boer and Briton
spoke the same language. During the first few days of the
campaign, surrenders of detachments of considerable strength
took place. These were not punished with sufficient severity.
One almost gains the impression that the men considered the
surrenders justifiable in order to escape from a difficult situation.</p>

<p>On the South African battlefields, devoid of cover and
swept for great distances by the hostile fire, it was indeed very
difficult to penetrate the hostile position, and retrograde movements
were undoubtedly attended with heavy losses. To this
may be added the fact that it was easy for the Boers, who
were mounted, to bar the way to isolated British forces. It
must be remembered, moreover, that the operations took place
during the hottest season and in a country where water is
scarce; and that the men felt they had arrived at the limit
of their powers of physical endurance at an earlier moment
than would have been the case under different conditions.
Thus, the surrender at Stromberg of troops exhausted from
a night march, is perhaps excusable; not so, however, the surrender
of Colonel Carleton’s detachment, which laid down its
arms at Nicholson’s Neck after offering a feeble resistance. In
the last-mentioned case, it is true, several Englishmen, who
had already laid down their arms, stood among the Boers so
that the commander of the British force did not really know
just what action to take in this situation. His hesitation decided
his fate. The demand must unquestionably be made in
future also,<a id="FNanchor185" href="#Footnote185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> that troops surrounded in the field make a serious
attempt to cut their way out before permitting thoughts of
surrender to enter their minds.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote185" href="#FNanchor185" class="label">[185]</a>
In contrast to this view the British court of inquiry found all but three
of the 226 surrenders, which occurred up to June 1st, 1900, justified. In the
three cases in which the verdict was adverse only a few men had surrendered.
Within a period of eight months the British lost a total of 1680 officers and
2124 men killed and wounded, while their loss in prisoners amounted to 182
officers and 4984 men.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It is impossible to determine theoretically what losses
troops are able to endure. After the Franco-German War it<span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span>
was believed that troops had reached the limit of endurance
after losing one-third to one-fourth of their strength. Nowadays
this limit would appear to be reached much sooner. It
may be pointed out, however, that the neglect of continuing the
attack at Colenso (loss 5.8%), and at Spionskop (loss 7.2%),
may, in part, be charged to lack of energy in the commander;
and that the Brigade of Highlanders, consisting of 2000 rifles
and deployed on a front of about 4000 m., in the engagement
at Paardeberg (loss 13.4%), lacked the necessary depth to
continue the attack. The greater the degree of efficiency and
freshness of troops, and the less the degree of suddenness with
which they enter a difficult situation, the greater the losses
which they will be capable of enduring. Furthermore, we
should not forget that our modern personnel has become much
more susceptible to the impressions of battle. The steadily
improving standards of living tend to increase the instinct of
self-preservation and to diminish the spirit of self-sacrifice.
The spirit of the times looks upon war as an avoidable evil,
and this militates directly against that courage which has a
contempt for death. The fast manner of living at the present
day undermines the nervous system,<a id="FNanchor186" href="#Footnote186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> the fanaticism and the
religious and national enthusiasm of a bygone age are lacking,
and, finally, the physical powers of the human species are also
partly diminishing. The influence exerted by officers on the
firing line is nowadays, however, considerably smaller than
in the past, so much so that they can actually control only the
nearest skirmishers. In addition, the nerve-racking impressions
on the battlefield are much greater at present than in the
past. The “<i>void of the battlefield</i>”<a id="FNanchor187" href="#Footnote187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
has become especially pronounced<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
since the introduction of smokeless powder. “<i>The
invisibility of the enemy directly affects the morale of the
soldier, the sources of his energy and his courage. The soldier
who cannot see his enemy, is inclined to see him everywhere.
It is but a step from this impression to hesitancy and
then to fear.</i> The inertia of the troops for whole days at
Magersfontain, Colenso, and Paardeberg, frequently more
than 800 m. from the enemy, was not produced by their losses,
but by the moral depression which is caused within the effective
zone of rifle fire.” (General <span class="smcap">Négrier</span>.)<a id="FNanchor188" href="#Footnote188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

turned away in disgust from a Chinese execution, he wrote: “And we Europeans

and this state we will reach more quickly than did the Russians, who were

<p>The remedies provided by the regulations against these
evils are, above all else: Restriction of the front of the several
units, the deployment of tactical units side by side in action
(instead of in rear of each other) and the use of every
opportunity for re-establishing the original organizations.
Other suggestions for stemming the tide of disorder as made
by the author of <cite>Summer Nights Dream</cite> (1888) (platoons
formed in single rank, volley firing, and constant closing
toward the center) are impracticable in a serious action. The
disintegrating effect of a battle is stronger than tactical
cohesion. It is better to recognize this fact than to face the
enemy with illusory ideas.</p>

<p>It is necessary to train the men in peace time to follow
willingly any officer, whether he belong to their own or to
another organization; and, for that reason, exercises in provisional
organizations are requisite for tactical training&mdash;a
large number of officers being told to fall out at these exercises
to assimilate losses which would occur in action. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span>
control of mixed firing lines by word of command of an officer
is the foundation of order and troop leading, and thus a prerequisite
of success in the battles of the future. In a successful
engagement, the evils above mentioned are less evident
than during a reverse when troops unexpectedly suffer heavy
losses or receive fire from the flank or rear. Troops formed
into well-organized units can well stand such a test, but in an
improvised organization, composed of fractions and men of
different units, especially when their own officers are absent,
such a crisis may lead to panic.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The following battle episode is very instructive: The 1st Battalion,
4th Infantry, deployed in line of company columns, advanced at <b>Colombey</b>
(14th August, 1870) under French shell and <i>Chassepot</i> fire. The morale
of the 3rd Company was visibly impaired by two shells which burst, one
after the other, in its ranks, placing 15-20 men out of action. “The men
began to hesitate; their steps grew shorter; and, as if impelled by an invisible
power, the company executed a half right turn, another half right
turn, then another and another. One would have thought the movement
was being executed at command. The column was now facing to the rear,
and although not running, not fleeing, it was moving back to the Brasserie
with suspiciously lengthening steps. The drummer, one Borchert, did
everything to bring the men to their senses; the non-commissioned officers
assisted bravely, but in vain; the column continued its movement to the
rear. Filled with shame and indignation, the perspiration pouring out of
every pore, I shouted to the men, repeatedly commanding: ‘Company
... Forward!’ But all in vain. At that moment the battalion commander&mdash;he
was called the ‘marble statue’ on account of his coolness&mdash;galloped
up on his bay, shouting: ‘Look at the 5th Company over yonder;
see how far it has advanced.’ Then another superior officer jumped in
front of the men with the words: ‘Is there no officer here at all?’ At
this instant I yelled again as if my life depended upon it: ‘You men
belong to the color company; Company ... Forward!’ and the spell
was broken. As if on the parade ground the Grenadiers faced to the
front; obediently they executed my command: ‘To the attack! Carry
arms ... Forward!’ and soon thereafter we again occupied our position
between the 2nd and 4th Companies.”</p>

<p>The company lost many men as soon as it entered the fight, among
them its company commander; then the two shells burst in rapid succession
within its ranks, and this explains the temporary panic. The company lost
a total of 86 men (including officers).<a id="FNanchor205" href="#Footnote205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<h4>1. NORMAL PROCEDURE.</h4>

<p>The characteristic tendency of modern times is the
liberation of the individual from antiquated ideas and from
the restraint exercised by ostensibly reactionary governmental
power. The key-note of this tendency, which places
individualism above collectivism, is absolute independence of
the individual in municipal and national affairs, in science
and art. Even tactics has been influenced to a certain extent
by this tendency. Success in battle, however, will not be
assured by the sum-total of a number of negative or positive
individual efforts, but only by the simultaneous launching
of masses controlled by a single will. Within these limits
the independence of the individual is permissible, for a commander
does not exact apathetic obedience, but, on the contrary,
intelligent coöperation on the part of everyone, and
this cannot be regulated by hard and fast rules.</p>

<p>Instead of laying down rules to cover all cases, the
German Drill Regulations leave the leader free to dispose
of his troops according to the purpose of the combat and
the nature of the ground. In this he is assisted by the
initiative and independent action of his subordinate leaders.
Normal formations for attack and defense are requisite however,
in armies in which the tactical training of commanders
and subordinate leaders is deficient and where it is feared
that the latter will abuse the latitude allowed them. Where
such normal formations are prescribed, it is assumed that
hard and fast rules are requisite for training; that the average
officer cannot be expected to estimate a situation correctly
and arrive at proper decisions; and that the majority<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
of them must be given definite rules for combat if they are
to render any service at all.</p>

<p>Drill regulations should facilitate quick mutual understanding
between leader and organization and lay down general
principles for ordinary situations, for combat tasks, and
for formations, but should not, by their rules, direct the
actions of a leader from the very beginning into definite
grooves. If the regulations contain a normal procedure, there
is danger that it will be employed where inappropriate, and
that the mental alertness of the leaders will relax and fail
in war at the very moment when its presence is most vitally
necessary.<a id="FNanchor207" href="#Footnote207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote207" href="#FNanchor207" class="label">[207]</a> “Leaders who have been trained only in the mechanical part of drill and
who subsequently have to act independently, fare like the lame man deprived
of his crutches, or the near-sighted man deprived of his spectacles.” <span class="smcap">von
Seidlitz</span>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“Tactics will always vary according to the nature of the
ground, therefore it is impossible to tell beforehand what
might happen in each particular case.” (<span class="smcap">Frederick the
Great</span>). Whether or not a particular normal procedure is
appropriate does not depend upon the terrain but solely
upon the tactical situation.<a id="FNanchor208" href="#Footnote208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote208" href="#FNanchor208" class="label">[208]</a> It is only in cases where precisely identical situations may be presumed to
exist that there can be any question of a normal procedure. The last stages
of the infantry attack in fortress warfare present features of this nature and
on that account a normal procedure has been formulated for it in almost all of
the European armies.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>While there is considerable unanimity of opinion as to
the general manner of carrying out an attack, opinions differ
radically as to details. “If all the advocates of a normal
attack had to describe it in words, there would be about as
many suggestions as there are advocates. Which of the
many normal attack schemes is the most suitable for average
troops? A conference called for the purpose of investigating
this point would probably have the strange result that
each representative would concede that what the others desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
is practicable but need not be done.”<a id="FNanchor209" href="#Footnote209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Anyone who thinks
himself capable of evolving a normal procedure, should bear
in mind that all such systems have invariably failed to fulfill
the expectations entertained for them because of obstacles
which could not have been foreseen during their preparation.
Regulations that prescribe too many details are very apt to
lead to stereotyped forms and to that which cannot stand the
test of actual war. So far every war has had surprises in
store for the troops and this will be equally true in the future.
Troops will be able to find a way out of such situations only
if they have been taught to follow the spirit rather than the
letter of their regulations, if they have been individually
trained and accustomed to strict discipline, and if their leaders
have been taught to reflect on tactics. It is better to send
troops into battle with the order, “Help yourselves as best you
can,” than to encumber them with combat rules of doubtful
value which leave them in the lurch at the first opportunity,
because the troops have not been taught to depend upon their
own initiative. The consequent indecision is increased in the
same proportion as the faith the troops and their leaders
had in the lauded universal remedy, the normal procedure.
In spite of the excellence of our regulations, we should accustom
ourselves to the idea that a future war may correct their
provisions.<a id="FNanchor210" href="#Footnote210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

of being changed to suit the various situations, the continual practice of it leads

will make themselves felt through losses and failures.”</p>

<p>The enunciation of certain technical combat principles
as a guide in the training of the troops is, however, far removed
from laying down a stereotyped form for attack
(normal attack). Every thinking officer will anyhow, consciously
or unconsciously, formulate in his own mind some
sort of a “normal attack”, which is nothing but a firm opinion
of how he thinks an attack ought to be carried out. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
such combat regulations are called “drill attack” (<i>Schulangriff</i>),
many of the objections advanced against the normal
attack are eliminated. Such definite provisions facilitate in
a great measure the intercourse between leader and troops.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>“Instructions as to what to do in battle,” says Clausewitz (<cite>On War</cite>,
II), “must not be taken for more than they are; they should not be regarded
as hard and fast rules or systems, but merely as good general
forms which individual judgment can utilize as is most suitable....
By means of a uniform method, commanders attain skill, precision, and
confidence, the possession of which qualities on their part will make the
whole machine run easier....</p>

<p>“The drawback is that the habit of acting in a certain groove tends
to become fixed and thus antiquated while the attendant circumstances imperceptibly
change, and this should be prevented by enlightened and
thorough criticism. When, in the year 1806, the Prussian generals (Prince
Louis at <b>Saalfeld</b>; Tauenzien on the <b>Dornberg</b> at <b>Jena</b>; Grawert in front
of and Rüchel in rear of <b>Kapellendorf</b>) without exception came to grief
by employing Frederick the Great’s system of tactics, it was due not merely
to the fact that they had gotten into a certain groove of acting which
was out of date, but to the most dire poverty of resource to which a fixed
system of tactics has ever led. Owing to this incapacity of thinking for
themselves, they involved Hohenlohe’s army in such ruin as has never
before or since overtaken any army on the battlefield.”</p>

<p>General von Boguslawski<a id="FNanchor211" href="#Footnote211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> demands that the conduct of the attack
be regulated by precise instructions both on the drill-ground and in action.
He states: “The many different methods of dealing with even the
simplest cases, unquestionably evident in the army at the present time,
are an evil calculated not only to train but also to confuse the soldier and
the subordinate leader. Precise regulations are by no means incompatible
with adaptation to the varying features of the terrain in a given case, and
will infuse unity and certainty into offensive movements. A normal formation
must be prescribed, but it should be flexible.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere he makes the following statement in regard to a normal
attack: “I believe that the normal attack should be regarded as the basis
of troop training&mdash;a solid foundation for further development. In carrying
out the spirit of this procedure, further work should be done on
varied ground. This spirit aims at the unity of the attack. The formations
taught on the drill-ground should be retained as long as possible.
The training of officers and men must be such, however, that they will
deviate, whenever necessary, from these normal formations. But if the
formations, as well as the training and drill, are truly practical and adapted
for war, departures from the scheme laid down in the regulations will be
insignificant. This, briefly, is my idea of the normal attack or uniform<span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span>
procedure, which not only does not have a detrimental effect, but, on the
contrary, is absolutely necessary in order to facilitate the work of the
higher leader.”</p>

<p>Column tactics, which influenced us even after the
Franco-German war, required that troops be concentrated,
prior to an action, from the narrow route column into a broad
combat formation. This tedious systematic <b>concentration</b><a id="FNanchor214" href="#Footnote214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
was invariably employed before entering an action, except
when, in critical situations, companies and battalions had to
be launched into the fight directly from route column. The
commander of a force could reduce the time required for going
into action only by approaching the field of battle in assembly
formation.<a id="FNanchor215" href="#Footnote215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote214" href="#FNanchor214" class="label">[214]</a> “By <i>concentration</i> is meant the passage from route column to a broader
close order formation. It is employed for the purpose of decreasing the depth
of a column and for assembly.” (Par. 315 German I. D. R.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote215" href="#FNanchor215" class="label">[215]</a> Examples: The approach of the IInd Army to the battlefield of Gravelotte,
see <cite>Taktik</cite>, III, p. 305.</p>

<p>The advance of the 1st Army from its cantonments toward the Bistrits
to the battlefield of Königgrätz was a mistake. The army first approached in
route columns, then concentrated, again formed route columns, and finally concentrated
for action. <span class="smcap">v. Lettow-Vorbeck</span>, II, pp. 407 and 480. From what I
know of the terrain the advance should in this case have been made in assembly
formations.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span></p>

<p>Valuable time was thus lost. Even when the situation
was not pressing, the leader was obliged, for example, to
allow a regiment having a depth of 1200 m. to close up to
a depth of 100 paces. When this had been done, he was
forced to wait until thin skirmish lines gained a proper distance
to the front. The rear elements were able to follow
only when the skirmishers had gained a distance approximately
equal to the former depth of the entire column. Such
a concentration is only proper however, when the commander
wishes to launch his troops subsequently in several
directions. Advantage should be taken of every opportunity
for decreasing the depth of the column (by forming column
of sections).</p>

<p>The advance of large bodies of troops presents no difficulties
even in close country, if, as recommended by the
author,<a id="FNanchor216" href="#Footnote216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> the battalions in route column are placed abreast
of each other and are permitted to go around obstacles and
take advantage of the cover available. However, even at
long ranges, troops in such formations present favorable
targets to hostile machine guns and artillery.</p>

<p>The British were surprised in close order formations at <b>Magersfontain</b>
and <b>Colenso</b>. In subsequent engagements, in order to avoid this,
their infantry, when still a great distance away from the enemy, took up
an attack formation which permitted only movements directly to the front
(at <b>Poplar Grove,</b> for example, this was done when 10 km. from the
enemy). An advance in such a formation was possible only because the
plains of South Africa presented no obstacles, and because the British had
only to hold the enemy who stood passively on the defensive. Each brigade
formed its four battalions into an open double column with a front
of 2000 and a depth of 800 m., the distances and intervals between battalions
being 300-400 m. Each battalion deployed from this column so
that its eight companies, each in a thin line (with 2 and finally 20 pace
intervals between the men), followed each other at a distance of 100-120
paces. The advantage of having troops in hand so that they can be used
in other directions than straight to the front, had disappeared.</p>

<p>When an engagement is expected, the different elements,
each in route column, are directed upon their several objectives,
i.e., the column is <i>developed for action</i>. This is done
because it is necessary to gain a start over the enemy in
deployment and advantageous to move in route column. Thus
a <b>development for action</b> (<i>Entfaltung</i>)<a id="FNanchor217" href="#Footnote217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> is nothing but an
extension of front accomplished by breaking up the original
route column into a number of separate columns. The latter
march on diverging lines and can generally remain in route<span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span>
column. Deep column should not be formed unless an immediate
extension is not anticipated. During the development
for action, preparations should be made providing for the
necessary depth of the combat formation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote217" href="#FNanchor217" class="label">[217]</a> The German I. D. R. make a distinction between extension of front,
“development for action” (<i>Entfaltung</i>, pars. 315 and 466), and “distribution in
depth” (<i>Gliedern</i>, pars. 287-291 and 427). The term “to form for attack”
(<i>Auseinanderziehen</i>, par. 241), means that troops are given a combat formation
both as regards frontage and depth.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>When the necessity for engaging can be foreseen, the
concentration into an assembly formation should be avoided,
since it generally entails a loss of time and energy, and the
development for action chosen instead. (Par. 315 German I.
D. R.). The latter has the additional advantage of affording
a higher degree of readiness for action without letting the
troops get out of hand. It should be practiced not only from
route column but also from assembly formation.<a id="FNanchor218" href="#Footnote218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote218" href="#FNanchor218" class="label">[218]</a> See the defeat of the Russian Reserve Brigade under Orlov on September
2nd, 1904, at Liao Yang, in <cite>Angriffsverfahren der Japaner</cite>, by von Lüttwitz.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The development for action should begin as soon as
there is danger of getting under effective artillery fire. The
length of time required for going into action may be reduced
by shortening the route column (by concentrating the troops
into deep column); by forming several route columns abreast,
unless column of sections has already been formed; by clearing
the roads of troops; by marching across country; by
indicating beforehand on which side of the infantry the
artillery is to be brought up (pars. 315-323 German I. D.
R.); and, finally, by directing the heads of the various elements
upon their respective objectives. (Development for
action).</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In the Austrian regulations, the development for action is not so
clearly emphasized: “A concentration preceding the attack in rencontres
is permissible in only those exceptional cases when it becomes apparent,
during the preparatory stage of the action, that the enemy has a visible
start in deployment.” When time is not pressing, the regulations prescribe
a concentration for action and, simultaneously therewith, such a grouping
of the principal units (if possible out of range of the effective fire of hostile
guns, and well concealed) that the attacking troops need move only
straight to the front. A more extended formation is taken up when the
zone of hostile artillery fire is reached. The march to the battlefield is
discussed in detail by the French regulations: In the first place, in order
to take advantage of cover and to keep the roads clear for artillery, it will
be necessary to leave the road and to advance across country. This will,<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
as a rule, result in widening the front of the advancing force, even though
this be only to the extent of placing columns abreast of each other. Hourly
halts are to be made, so as to give an opportunity for replenishing ammunition
and time for reconnaissance. Small columns are preferred in woods
and in close country and larger columns on passable ground. Attention is
specially called to the danger to which troops are exposed when surprised
in defiles by hostile fire. This march to the battlefield is followed by a concentration
of the troops in concealed and protected positions.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The <b>deployment for action</b> (<i>Entwicklung</i>) consists of
forming the troops for battle and includes the extension into
line of skirmishers. As a rule, the deployment follows the
development for action, but may be made directly from route
column or from an assembly formation.</p>

<p>It is impossible to define clearly where the development
for action ceases and where the deployment begins. The
formation of a line of skirmishers to cover a route column
does not constitute a deployment. There is no room for
doubt that the regulations have in mind the rencontre, in
which the passage from route column to skirmish line proceeds
naturally and smoothly. In attacking an enemy prepared
to defend a position, the procedure is much more
cautious. In this case the force which has been developed
for action is withdrawn as much as possible from the view
and the fire of the enemy (par. 367 German I. D. R.), and
led forward from cover to cover. (Par. 369 German I. D. R.).
Even in situations in which haste is required, it is a good
plan to follow the procedure laid down by the regulations,
viz: “First direct the troops upon the proper objective, then
give them a suitable formation.”</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>An analysis of the question as to whether an immediate launching of
troops into action is necessary (5th Infantry Division at <b>Vionville</b>) or
whether they should first be regularly concentrated (6th Infantry Division
at <b>Vionville</b>) is of special interest. The concentration of the 1st Prussian
Army Corps at <b>Waterloo</b>, and of the 5th Bavarian Infantry Brigade at
<b>Nehweiler</b> (<b>Wörth</b>), almost in rear of the French, is justly criticised. At
<b>Nachod</b>, the Austrian brigades, owing to their time-consuming concentration,
lost an opportunity of throwing the weak Prussian advanced troops
from the heights south of Wysokow, while the latter were reinforced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span>
parts of the main body which arrived by half-battalions. This reinforcement,
while made in driblets, was, however, sufficient.</p>

<p>During its march to the battlefield of <b>Gravelotte</b>, the 3rd Infantry
Division concentrated at Buxieres for the purpose of cooking. Then it
formed again in route column, concentrated once more south of Rezonville,
and from there moved on in echelon formation. The concentration
of the 28th Infantry Brigade on August 6th, 1870 (<b>Spicheren</b>), was still
less justifiable. About noon, when the head of the brigade reached the
exit of the Kollertal Wood at Raschpfuhl, it received orders to cross the
Saar. Upon receiving this order, the five battalions present concentrated,
unfurled their flags and then marched across country to the railroad bridge
of Mattstall. In order to effect a crossing, route column had to be formed
again. The delays which occurred here led the parts of the force which had
crossed first, to throw themselves into the fight.<a id="FNanchor219" href="#Footnote219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<h4>3. THE BATTALION, THE REGIMENT, AND THE
BRIGADE.</h4>

<p>When part of a larger force, the battalion may be broken
up into companies either by directing the latter upon their
respective objectives, or by forming for attack by command.</p>

<p>When forming for attack by command, the front, the
base company, intervals, distances, and the relation of the
companies to each other must be indicated. The intervals
should be sufficiently large to permit the companies to move
unhampered, and so maintained that irregularities of marching
will not be communicated from one to the other.</p>

<p>A space approximately equal to the front of a platoon
will suffice for this purpose. Thus the interval between companies
at war strength would be 150 paces, and between
companies at peace strength 100 paces. Intervals may be
increased or diminished when necessary so as to enable the
troops to take the fullest advantage of cover. The same
holds true for distances. For rules in regard to the distance
between the second and first line, see <a href="#Page121">p. 121</a>, supra. When
a battalion has formed line of companies at long range from
the enemy for the purpose of reducing the effect of the hostile<span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span>
fire, distances should be diminished to facilitate the transmission
of orders.</p>

<p>When the battalion is acting alone, the intervals depend
upon the purpose of the combat. In the fights around Mukden,
some of the Japanese battalions, stationed at points
where the decision was not sought, were each assigned a
front of 800 m. In these cases the four companies of each
battalion had to be deployed abreast of each other at large
intervals.</p>

<div class="container w40em">

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo211.png" alt="Battle order" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p>It is impossible to prescribe fixed forms of deployment
for particular situations. In each case the formation of the
battalion depends upon the situation, the purpose of the
combat, and the nature of the ground, the battalion commander
having the option of going into action in one, two,
or three lines.</p>

<p>Moreover, the formation depends upon <span class="nowrap">whether&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The battalion is acting alone or as part of a larger
force; and whether one or both of its flanks are resting on
impassable obstacles;</p>

<p>2. Whether it is fighting a decisive or a containing action;
whether it is to attack or to stand on the defensive;</p>

<p>3. Whether it is to prepare the attack by its own fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page212">[212]</span>
or is to take advantage of the preparation effected by other
troops; and, finally,</p>

<p>4. Whether or not it has to fight at night.</p>

<p><b>A battalion acting alone</b>, whose flanks are not resting
on natural obstacles, will, as a rule, place entire companies
successively into action so as to retain complete organizations
for other purposes. It will seldom be proper for the battalion
to form for attack in the regular manner. When this
can be done the battalion should form in three lines in conformity
with its task of initiating, carrying out, and deciding
the fight. In this case the leading company is reinforced
by the second company as soon as the situation has become
sufficiently clear. More frequently, the battalion commander
will send only a single company into action, retaining the
others for the time being under cover.</p>

<p>The <b>advance guard battalion</b> of a regiment will, as a
rule, be compelled to develop considerable fire in a <i>rencontre</i>
(par. 357 German I. D. R.), in order to check the advance
of the enemy, and for this purpose it will frequently place
two companies into action at once. But since the battalion
commander cannot count upon reinforcements and, moreover,
as he does not know on which flank the combat is subsequently
going to develop, he will provisionally retain the
other two companies in rear of the center, or echelon them
in rear of both flanks. (See “a” and “b” above <a href="#Ref5">figure</a>).</p>

<p>In a <b>containing action</b> one should endeavor to employ
few rifles but, on the other hand, expend much ammunition,
and keep supports and reserves far in rear so as to minimize
the losses. If the force is to deploy first of all only for fire
action, but is later to participate in the decisive attack, it
will be advisable to place two companies in the first line, one
in the second, and one in the third. The companies in the
second and third lines will then be less exposed to hostile
fire, and the battalion commander will be able, by first launching
one and then the other company, to exercise an influence
on the course of the action during a longer period than
would otherwise be possible. (See “<a href="#Ref5">b</a>”).</p>

<p><b>When a battalion is fighting as part of a larger force</b>,
and when both its flanks are secure, it will need only supports
for feeding the frontal attack (par. 289 German I. D. R.)
and can cover a greater front. A reserve may either be entirely
dispensed with, or made very weak.</p>

<p>When only one flank of the battalion is secure, the threatened
flank should be protected by echeloning the supports
and the reserve in rear of it. In this position, these echelons
are not so apt to be bullet-stops as when they are placed in
rear of the center. Besides, they can more easily execute
enveloping movements and can take a hostile flank attack in
flank. When both flanks are in the air, only the most essential
precautions should be taken on the one flank, while on the
other everything available is united for the decisive attack.</p>

<p>In <b>defense</b>, three companies can sometimes be taken
into the first line for the purpose of developing a strong fire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page214">[214]</span>
while the fourth company is held in rear of a threatened
flank or in rear of the center. (See “<a href="#Ref6">d</a>”). When it is desired
to employ the reserve offensively, only one or two companies
are placed in the first line, the others being held in
reserve in rear of the flank which is to take the offensive.
Interval and distance increase with the size of this reserve.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When a battalion from the reserve is called upon to
make an immediate attack which has been prepared by the
fire of other troops, all its companies may be taken at once
into the first line. In this case the battalion may be formed
for attack with its companies at close intervals. This might
also be a suitable combat formation for night operations.
All these formations are subject to change however, as soon
as the proper utilization of cover makes it necessary.</p>

<p>The general principles stated for a battalion are also
applicable to a <b>regiment</b>. The regiment may either be directly
formed for attack, or the heads of the battalions may be
deflected toward the points where the deployment is to take
place. An interval of 300-400 m. between heads of battalions
is best calculated to facilitate the subsequent deployment.
The distances depend upon the nature of the ground and the
purpose of the combat.</p>

<p>The regimental commander assigns tasks to his battalion
commanders, but leaves the latter entire freedom of action in
regard to the formation to be taken up and the manner of
deploying. He should interfere with companies only in exceptional<span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span>
cases. Such interference is justified only when the
conduct of subordinate leaders threatens to impair unity of
action in the combat and when time is lacking to observe
the proper channels in communicating an order.</p>

for action, the depth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span>

<p>When an infantry brigade approaching the battlefield is
to prolong the flank of the fighting line, its entry into action
might be hastened, perhaps, by letting the rear regiment continue
the march in the original direction while the leading
regiment takes the longer route. The rear regiment would
then be abreast of the leading one after about 15 minutes. If
the battalions are subsequently developed on radiating lines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
the development of the whole force will, after a few minutes,
have progressed far enough to permit a deployment of
skirmishers.</p>

<p>When the brigade takes up a combat formation, each
regiment is assigned a separate task (attack of a point, or
defense of a section). If the tasks assigned are definite and
harmonize with each other, mutual coöperation will be assured.
The brigade commander ordinarily sends his orders to the
regimental commanders, but, when circumstances (haste, correction
of errors) compel him to depart from this rule, he
should inform those officers of the action taken. In a brigade
consisting of two regiments, its commander, in order to be
able to influence the action, will be compelled to retain at least
one battalion as a reserve.</p>

<p>Brigades of three regiments<a id="FNanchor221" href="#Footnote221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> (each of three battalions)
have an advantage in this respect. But if such an increase
in infantry units were contemplated, it would be better, for
reasons that will be given later on,<a id="FNanchor222" href="#Footnote222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> to form the additional
troops into a third division in each army corps.</p>

<h5>Base Units.</h5>

<p>The possibility of regulating the movements of a body
of troops by means of a base unit, depends upon a number of
preliminary conditions which will seldom be fulfilled in war:</p>

<p>1. <i>The leader of the base unit would have to remain
unharmed to the very last.</i> If he were disabled the command
of the unit would devolve upon the next in rank who
would perhaps not join it in every case.</p>

<p>2. <i>The fresh organisation which imparts the impetus
necessary for a further advance, would have to maintain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span>
direction after the original base unit had ceased to exist on
account of the mixing of organizations.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>The base unit would have to encounter less difficulties
during its advance than the other units of the force.</i>
If the base unit were to encounter greater difficulties than
the other units, this might serve as an excuse for reducing
the rate of advance. In attack, the organization nearest the
enemy, in other words, the one that is led better and more
energetically than the others, is quite naturally charged with
maintaining the direction. Moreover, this organization will
be able to facilitate by its fire the advance of the elements
in rear.</p>

<p>The designation of a base unit<a id="FNanchor223" href="#Footnote223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> or unit of direction
on the battlefield cripples the energy of an entire line and the
initiative of the individual in favor of uniformity of movement.
A base unit is only profitable in night operations, in
crossing unfavorable ground (woods), and in bringing the
fighting line up to the effective zone of hostile fire. “With
the entry into action, the importance of the base company
gradually decreases as the demands made by the combat increase”.
(Par. 242 German I. D. R.). In all other cases,
it is better to indicate either the objective on which the
troops are to march, or the flank toward which they are to

<p>3. The wheel executed by Kottwitz’ Brigade during the battle of
<b>Loigny-Poupry</b> (2nd Dec., 1870). (This is also cited as an example of the
conduct of a counter-attack made by the defender). Toward noon the
advance guard of the 17th Infantry Division held <b>Lumeau</b>. The 33rd Brigade,
its battalions in double column, was concentrated south of <b>Champdoux</b>.
The division commander retained two battalions as a reserve and
ordered Major-General von Kottwitz “to execute a quarter wheel to the
right and to form his command for attack in the general direction of
Loigny,” for the purpose of relieving the pressure on the Bavarians defending
<b>Schlosz Goury</b>. The attack was directed against the French Division
Jauréguiberry, which was attacking Schlosz Goury. This division first came
under fire at 3-400 m. and then approached to within about 150 m. of the
defenders’ position; strong reserves followed in rear of its right flank, but
otherwise nothing was done to protect the right.</p>

<p>By wheeling at once to the right, the right wing of Kottwitz’ Brigade
would still have struck the eastern garden wall of Schlosz Goury, and, as
Loigny had been indicated to the general as the objective, a fan-shaped
extension of the brigade, precluding mutual coöperation, would have been
unavoidable. The general had fourteen companies at his disposal and
decided to advance in a southerly direction until his second line overlapped
the most advanced hostile line, so that the attack as planned would have
struck simultaneously both the first and second lines of the enemy. The
slight loss of time involved caused the general no uneasiness, as he could
carry out his intentions without interference beyond range of the fire of the
enemy, whom he could observe during the entire movement. The brigade
formed for attack, during its movement to the south, when about 1200 m.
from Goury. The general, who was on the right flank, halted the brigade
after it had advanced far enough, and wheeled it to the right.</p>

<p>As the second line overlapped the first, the Füsilier Battalion of the 76th
Infantry had to shorten its step until the 2nd and 3rd Companies of the
same regiment had come abreast and until the 6th and 8th Companies of
the 75th Infantry had also joined the line. The center half-battalion, (2nd
and 3rd Companies of the 76th Infantry), the unit of direction, was ordered
to march on the church spire of Loigny. All the units of the force, with
the exception of the IInd Battalion, 76th Infantry, at once deployed lines of
skirmishers. The 1st and 4th Companies, 76th Infantry, and 5th Company,
75th Infantry, covered the left flank and turned toward Ecuillon. Of the
eleven companies launched in this flank attack, six were in the first line
(approximately 1100 rifles on a front of 800 m.), and five in the second.</p>

<p>The bulk of the second line, in an endeavor to close with the enemy
quickly, joined the firing line when 400 m. from the enemy. The attack
came as a complete surprise to the French; their lines were taken in flank,
and all their attempts to form new defensive lines to oppose the onslaught
of the Hansards proved unavailing. The dense, unwieldy masses of the
French were more and more crowded together by the uninterrupted
advance of the Hansards and offered good objectives to the German
marksmen. The advance of the brigade was supported by the artillery in
position near Lumeau. This artillery followed the brigade to Ecuillon.</p>

<p>The Hansards traversed a distance of 3500 m. during this attack. The
right wing and the bulk of the 2nd and 3rd Companies, 76th Infantry,

<p>The infantry combat is decided by the combined action
of long firing lines. Retained forces, not launched against
the enemy for the purpose of crushing him, exert no influence
whatever on the decision, since they only increase losses
without contributing to the fire effect. In the battles of the
past, distribution in depth at the decisive stage of the combat
(unless necessary as a measure of precaution, in securing the
flanks, for example), was only permissible so long as the
short range of the weapons allowed reserves to be kept in
readiness so close to the firing line that they could assault
<i>en masse</i> at once and without any diminution of their
strength. The deciding factor, which rested in retained reserves
during the Napoleonic era, lies at present in the firing
line.<a id="FNanchor229" href="#Footnote229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

to secure its flanks. Victory is assured only by the simultaneous
employment of superior fighting forces. A force
should go into action in a deep combat formation, but it must
extend its front during the fight.</i> To launch an insufficient
number of troops for combat and to reinforce them gradually

demonstrated that such a small force was insufficient for taking the Turkish
work, only two regiments were again sent forward to the attack (in other
words, 6 battalions instead of 18). When this assault had also been
repulsed, and one regiment from the reserve had in addition been thrown
in, 6 battalions of the 15 still intact, were again sent forward, but they

<p>Distribution in depth is necessary during the preparatory
stage of the fight, as it enables the commander to meet
unexpected developments in the situation. Moreover, it is
justifiable so long as the information in regard to the strength
and intentions of the enemy is insufficient. When reconnaissance
work is not thoroughly performed, the force may be
obliged to deploy in a direction other than the one originally
chosen. This will be difficult to do as changes of front and
movements by the flank can only be made when the front is
narrow. Moreover, after a force is once deployed within
the zone of hostile fire, it is committed to the direction chosen
and can only move straight to the front. Considerable
changes of front can only be executed by the lines in rear.
The troops held in rear are to reinforce the firing line and
to increase its density to the maximum at the decisive moment.
As the losses are smaller in defense than in attack, a
force can cover a broader front and keep its supports in
closer proximity to the firing line in the former than in the
latter case, especially if it was able to strengthen its position.
The reserve, however, should be kept at a greater distance
from the firing line than in attack, in order that it may retain
complete freedom of movement&mdash;in covering the retreat, or
in making a counter-attack&mdash;and may not be involved in the
fire fight.</p>

<p>The reserves of the attacker are to protect the flanks,
give the impetus for the assault, serve as a force upon which
the attacking line can rally, and cover the re-forming of the
troops after a successful attack. The several echelons of the
attack formation, except the small fractions immediately
supporting the firing line<a id="FNanchor233" href="#Footnote233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> and covering its flanks, should
have become merged with that line by the time the decisive
moment of the combat arrives. The commander who takes
up an unnecessarily deep attack formation dispenses with an
advantage; on the other hand, the one who prematurely deploys<span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span>
in force, exposes himself to grave danger. <i>The troops
should be sent into action in a deep combat formation, since
the firing line is to be fed from the rear until the decisive
moment arrives, but every available man should be thrown in
for the assault.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><b>Distribution in depth and frontage</b> are interdependent;
the greater the frontage, the less the distribution in depth,
and vice versa. In every deployment for action the following
question awaits solution by the troop leader: “How deep
ought the formation to be and how great an extension of
front is allowable.” The result of the combat depends in
many cases upon a happy answer to this question. Broad
combat formations have great initial energy, facilitate turning
and flank movements, but their energy is not constant when
the means are not available to replace casualties. In addition,
the difficulty of leading, the danger of the line being
penetrated, and the weakness of the flanks grow apace with
the extension of front. Distribution in depth makes it possible
to initiate the combat with a part of the force and to
get information of the situation; to fight the action with another
part of the force in accordance with this information;
and, finally, to bring about the decision and reap the fruits
of that decision with the third part. A deep combat formation
enables the leader to exercise a constant influence on
the course of action; it gives him the means with which to
execute turning movements or to repulse them&mdash;something
which would be entirely impossible, or, at any rate, only possible
under great difficulties, with troops deployed in the first
line. As only a limited number of rifles can be brought into
play in a deep combat formation, it is obvious that this is an
element of weakness of which an opponent deployed on a
broader front, may take advantage.</p>

<p>Although the danger of going too far in distributing a
force in depth is not inconsiderable, this is, at any rate, a
smaller error than the opposite extreme, that of deploying
troops, from the very start, on too broad a front.</p>

<p>At noon on August 6th, 1870, General von François received an order
for his brigade to dislodge the hostile artillery posted on the <b>Roten Berg</b>
of the <b>Spicheren Heights</b>,<a id="FNanchor234" href="#Footnote234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> it being assumed that only insignificant hostile
forces were in front. The other brigade of the 14th Division was expected
to be able to take part in the action in about three hours. When the
attacking force was 2000 m. from its objective, the IInd Battalion, 74th
Infantry, and the IIIrd Battalion, 39th Infantry, were set in motion against
the French right flank, while the Ist Battalion and the Füsilier Battalion of
the 74th Infantry were retained as a reserve. The brigade accordingly
covered a front of about 4000 m. While the frontal attack on the Roten
Berg was undoubtedly difficult,<a id="FNanchor235" href="#Footnote235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> this wide extension, which made all leading
impossible, increased the difficulties still further. In the first place, the
brigade commander led his two reserve battalions against the Roten Berg
and fell finally while leading a company. The brigade was too weak to
carry out the task imposed upon it. The 28th Brigade, which followed,
came into action at various points of the battlefield, so that the two brigades
became mixed, thus considerably increasing the difficulties of leading. At

<p>In deciding how many men are required to occupy or
attack a position, the principal point to be considered is the
effect of fire. The modern long range magazine rifle will,
no doubt, enable us to defend a position with a smaller force
than was possible in the past with the older less improved
weapons. However, combats last longer nowadays, and the
shock action of Frederick the Great’s tactics is no longer
practicable. The fight is carried on at longer ranges, and the
tremendously costly decisive moments of the past are of rarer
occurrence. As a consequence, the casualties of the whole
force engaged are smaller, although, owing to unfavorable
conditions, certain organizations may suffer losses quite as
great as those incurred in the battles of Frederick the Great
and Napoleon.<a id="FNanchor239" href="#Footnote239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Instead of the sanguinary hand-to-hand
fight with cold steel, we now have a prolonged fire fight
carried on by a firing line which requires to be constantly
fed by troops held in rear, who have to be sheltered as much as
possible from hostile fire until the moment of their employment.
This fire fight is frequently decided by psychological
factors and without the troops suffering material losses.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote239" href="#FNanchor239" class="label">[239]</a> At Wörth, the 1st Turco Regiment lost the enormous total of 93.1%, and

May, 1811), the 57th Regiment (British) and the Füsilier Brigade lost 70%;

<p>“The duration of the combat under modern conditions,”
writes General Négrier,<a id="FNanchor240" href="#Footnote240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> “leads to a considerable mental exhaustion
of the troops which is apparent in nervous lassitude.<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
This explains the impotency of leader and troops the
day after a defeat and even after a victory. This lassitude
is still greater on the day of the battle. While it is true that
this has always been the case, the nervous exhaustion has
grown in an inconceivable manner, its intensity increasing at
the same rate as the invisibility of the opponent. <i>The invisibility
of the enemy directly affects the morale of the
soldier, the sources of his energy and courage. The soldier
who cannot see his enemy is inclined to see him everywhere.
It is but a step from this impression to hesitancy and then to
fear.</i> The inertia of the troops for whole days at Magersfontain,
Colenso, and Paardeberg, frequently more than 800
m. from the enemy, was not caused by their losses, but by the
moral depression produced within the effective zone of rifle
fire. Another factor, which governs the modern combat at
short ranges, the <i>impossibility of the commander making his
influence felt in lines which are seriously engaged</i>, is of still
greater importance. <i>The influence of the officers who lead
these lines is also limited. They are scarcely able to direct
the three or four men nearest them.</i> The combat depends
upon the individual fighters, and there never has been a time
when the personal efficiency of the individual soldier has had
a greater significance.” We should not forget that this change
occurred during a period in which we no longer fight our battles
with professional soldiers of long service, but, on the contrary,
with peace cadres of our conscript armies raised to war
strength by Reservists.</p>

<p>Another factor to be considered is the fighting quality
of the opponent. In an action against an enemy who is a
match for us, the necessity for distribution in depth is, of
course, greater than when fighting against poor troops.</p>

<p>General v. Werder could with impunity oppose the newly raised levies
of the French Republic on the <b>Lisaine</b> with 1.12 men per meter of front.
The victory was won by this very extraordinary extension of front, which,

<p><i>Considerations of importance in deciding upon the extent
of front to be covered by a force, similar conditions on both
sides being presumed,</i> <span class="nowrap"><i>are</i>&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Whether it is compelled to fight an independent action
alone</i>;</p>

<p>2. <i>Whether it is fighting, from the preparatory to the
decisive stage of the combat, as part of a larger body, with at
least one, or perhaps both flanks secured</i>;</p>

<p>3. <i>Whether it has been selected to make the decisive attack
against an enemy already shaken by other troops</i>.</p>

<p>In the last mentioned case a sudden effect, a short, powerful
blow, is required, and the maximum frontage of all the
units employed on the same line is admissible. But even a
force advancing to the final assault can by no means dispense
with distribution in depth; supports and reserves are needed
to carry forward the firing line when it has been checked, to
cover its flanks, and to carry on the pursuit (second line).</p>

<p>The frontage of an organization whose flanks are secure
and which is acting as a part of a larger force, depends upon
other troops; considerable extension of front is admissible
provided the firing line is constantly maintained at a strength
which will enable it to gain a superiority of fire over the
enemy. “While an organization which has only one flank
protected, is less restricted as regards frontage, it will have
to provide for distribution in depth on the exposed flank. In
this case, it is a good plan to move the units held in rear
toward the particular flank (echeloning). Interval and distance
increase with the size of this echelon.” (Par. 290 German
I. D. R.). The German Infantry Drill Regulations (par.
397) further emphasize the fact that, when well-trained infantry
employs its rifles to good advantage in defense, it is
very strong in front; that it can hold a position with a comparatively
small force; and that, in this case, it has only one
weak spot, the flank, which it must seek to protect by distribution
in depth. This view is fully borne out by the recent events
in South Africa and in Manchuria. Under favorable conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
(deliberate defense), a battalion fighting as part of a
larger force may put all of its companies into the first line, a
front of 200 m. being assigned to each. The battalion can
thus defend a front of 800 m. The only restriction is the requirement
that the battalion commander must be able, at all
times, to direct the course of the combat.</p>

<p>An organization acting alone which has to fight an action
independently from beginning to end under varying conditions,
cannot employ all of its available strength in the first
line at one time. A distribution into three parts, viz., firing
line, supports, and reserve, is therefore required. During the
preparatory stage, the firing line should be as weak as possible,
while, for sustaining and deciding the action, the reserve
should be as strong as possible. As a rule, this distribution
will not come into existence until the combat has begun; it
must disappear again, during the subsequent course of the
fight, through reinforcement of the troops that initiated the
action, thus resulting in an increase of the combat front.</p>

<p>While the frontage is thus increased, an equal density
along the entire attacking line is not produced. This is due to
the fact that one will endeavor to increase the distribution in
depth only at the point where the decision is sought (offensive
wings), while one will seek to obtain results by a generous
expenditure of ammunition at points where the enemy is only
to be contained. When a broad front has to be held with a
weak force, it is a good plan to post the troops in groups. Of
the attack as well as of the defense it may be said, that the
skillful combination of the offensive and defensive advantages
of a piece of ground is a sign of good leadership. (Austerlitz).
Frequently, however, after an action is over, the assault that
penetrated a line is called the main attack, and the one that
failed, a demonstration. An organization fighting alone will
generally begin an action by deploying on a narrow front; it
will protect its flanks by distribution in depth; and, finally,
mass troops at the decisive point in readiness to make the assault.<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
The force making an assault in attack or a counter-attack
in defense cannot be strong enough.</p>

<p>Another factor that must be considered in deciding upon
the frontage is the task which a force is to perform, <i>i.e.</i>,
whether it is to make an attack or to stand on the defensive;
whether it is to fight a delaying action or is to withdraw. The
object of distribution in depth is to keep the firing line constantly
at the same strength; this requires stronger reinforcements
in attack (owing to the greater losses), than in defense,
and leads, consequently, to a contraction of the front.</p>

<p>The number of troops which will be required to hold a
given piece of ground must be determined separately in each
case. The strength of the fighting line depends upon the
effect of the hostile fire. Military history tells us how many
troops the leader sent into action in order to gain the victory,
but it seldom gives us a clue as to the number of troops that
might have sufficed in the particular case.</p>

<p>In deploying from route column in a rencontre, the leading
battalion may be fully engaged by the time the next one
arrives on the battlefield. In such cases, the tactical situation
may require the employment of longer firing lines than would
be deemed proper for the size of the command when making
a more serious attack. (Par. 357 German I. D. R.). The assailant
should then endeavor to throw the enemy, who is likewise
advancing, on the defensive. The situation is similar to
that in which an advance guard has to cover the main body’s
debouchment from a defile.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>At <b>Nachod</b>, five Prussian battalions, which had only two companies in
reserve, fought on a front of 2500 m. from 8 A. M. until noon.</p>

<p>The conduct of the advance guard of the 8th Infantry Division at
<b>Beaumont</b> is worthy of imitation. In this case, the support battalion was
deployed and the artillery went into position; strong detachments were
retained in rear of the left wing until the main body had arrived. Likewise,
a proper relation existed between frontage (4 battalions on a front
of 1400 m.) and distribution in depth. According to the General Staff
Account of the Franco-German war (II, p. 1045), the distribution was as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span></p>

<p><i>First line</i>: 4th Jäger-Battalion, which was subsequently reinforced
by the IInd Battalion, 96th Infantry and the Ist and IInd Battalions, 86th
Infantry.</p>

<p><i>Support for the Artillery</i>: Füsilier Battalion, 96th Infantry.</p>

<p><i>Reserve</i>: IIIrd Battalion, 86th Infantry.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned the deployment of the advance guard at
<b>Spicheren</b> (<a href="#Page226">p. 226</a> supra). In that instance the whole force was thrown
in at once, whereas at <b>Beaumont</b> the deployment of the different units
was coördinated and proceeded systematically. An advance guard should
be able to repulse an attack and then assume the offensive without outside
assistance. An example which is not worthy of imitation is the engagement
of the 29th Infantry Brigade at the <b>Hallue</b>. The brigade began the
fight, without being compelled to do so, and deployed its 4530 men on a
front of 5000 m. The 30th Infantry Brigade (4070 men) then entered the
fight and deployed on a front of 3000 m. in prolongation of the line of
the 29th Brigade. If the French had made a decisive attack at this point,
the 15th Infantry Division would not have been able to repulse it.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>Distribution in depth, for the purpose of warding off an
enveloping movement and for making a counter-attack, is
more necessary in defense than in attack; besides, a greater
front may be covered in the former case on account of the
smaller losses. The following factors in part determine the
extent of front to be occupied and the number of troops required
to defend it: (1) the strength, natural or artificial, of
the position; (2) obstacles in its front; (3) salient angles
which can be easily enveloped; (4) the intentions of the commander
(<i>i.e.</i>, whether he contemplates fighting a purely defensive
combat or one including offensive action).</p>

<p><b>Delaying actions</b> are usually fought at long and medium
ranges as purely passive defensive combats and no provision
is made for replacing casualties, the object of the fight being
to avoid a decision. Few men should, therefore, be placed in
the firing line, but these should be supplied with abundant ammunition.
However, as the force desires to avoid a decisive
engagement by withdrawing, distribution in depth should be
provided to protect the flanks and to facilitate breaking off
the action. (Par. 419 German I. D. R.). This requires that
distances be great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page233">[233]</span></p>

<p><b>Night attacks</b>, on account of the element of surprise involved,
do not require great distribution in depth; as a rule,
the fight is decided in a very short time by the collision of the
opposing forces. However, measures must be taken to protect
the flanks, to ensure victory, and to give the first line the
impetus necessary to carry it forward in case it is checked.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The British attack on the Egyptian position at <b>Tel el Kebir</b> (1882)
was made by only 11,000 men on a front of about 6 km. After a short
fight the works were taken.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>An attempt will now be made to give some approximate
figures for the extent of front that may be occupied in various
situations.</p>

<p>Assuming one rifle for every three meters of front occupied,
the following might suffice for temporarily defending a
line 1000 m. long:</p>

<table class="dontwrap nomargin" summary="Rifles needed">

<tr>
<td class="left padr2">Firing line</td>
<td class="right padr1">300</td>
<td class="left">rifles</td>

<tr>
<td class="center">Total</td>
<td class="right padr1">820</td>
<td class="left">rifles</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Thus 0.8 men per meter would be sufficient. This is
borne out by the Boer War. With a good field of fire, even
a thin firing line, provided with plenty of ammunition, is capable
of bringing any attack to a standstill, at least for the
time being.</p>

<p><b>A defense seeking a decision</b> requires fighting at short
ranges; the firing line must be kept constantly at the same
strength; losses of about one-fifth (killed, wounded, and missing)
must be reckoned with; and, finally, a reserve, consisting
of about a third of the effective strength of the force, is required
for making the counter-attack. The firing line is, from
the outset, made as dense as possible, and echelons posted on
the flanks must oppose any advance against the flanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span></p>

<p>The following would thus suffice for defending a front
of 1000 m.:</p>

<table class="dontwrap nomargin" summary="Men needed">

<tr>
<td class="left padr2">Firing line</td>
<td class="right padr1">1000</td>
<td class="left">men</td>

<td class="center">Total</td>
<td class="right padr1">2400</td>
<td class="left">men</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Hence, 2.4 rifles per meter of front would be available
for defense.</p>

<p>The defense is decided by a successful counter-attack
made by the reserve, whereas the attack requires an additional
force to cover and assure the assembling and re-forming of
the troops. The greater force is naturally required by the attacker,
who must be stronger than the defender at the moment
when the assault is made. The following would be required
for making an attack on a front of 1000 m.:</p>

<table class="dontwrap nomargin" summary="Men needed">

<tr>
<td class="left padr2">Firing line</td>
<td class="right padr1">1200</td>

<td class="center">Total</td>
<td class="right padr1">4200</td>
<td class="left">rifles</td>

</table>

<p>This would be equivalent to 4.2 rifles per meter of front.</p>

<p>These figures can only serve as a very general guide, of
course, and should be considered minima.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The number of troops required for attack or defense must be determined
separately for each individual case. At <b>Lovtcha</b>, 25 battalions, 92
guns, and 15 sotnias were not considered too large a force for attacking
8000 Turks with only 6 guns. At <b>Gorni Dubniac</b>, 3 infantry divisions of
the Guard, with 90 guns, attacked 6 weak Turkish battalions having only
4 guns. After the first two unsuccessful assaults on <b>Plevna</b>, the Russians
overestimated the strength of the enemy. Osman Pasha’s force was estimated
at 80,000 men, and, consequently, during the September assaults,
90,000 men and 400 guns were deemed necessary to attack barely 40,000
Turks and 60 guns.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span></p>

<p>From a consideration of the foregoing, it appears that
the <b>maximum frontage</b> is justifiable, when a force whose
flanks are secure, occupies a position prepared for defense, or
acts as a reserve and is to bring about a decision which has
been prepared by other troops. On the other hand, the <b>maximum
distribution in depth</b> is necessary for a force acting
alone in attack with both flanks exposed. Between these two
extremes lie many intermediate degrees, and it is therefore
impossible to lay down hard and fast rules for the frontage of
an attacking force. The German Infantry Drill Regulations
(par. 373) accordingly fix the frontage of a company in attack
at 150 m. and that of a brigade of six battalions at 1500
m. It is impossible to give a definite ratio of effective strength
to combat frontage. Thus, while in attack a company puts
into the line about 1.3 rifles per meter of its front, the brigade
employs 4 rifles per meter, and the larger units a proportionally
greater number. The necessity for distribution in depth
increases with the size of the force and with the number of
units composing it.</p>

<p>In a company, for example, a platoon is sufficient to fulfill,
within certain limits, all the functions of a reserve, while in a
larger force the duties of a reserve are so complex that each
task (protecting the flanks, reinforcing the firing line, giving
the impetus for the assault, and covering the assembling and
re-forming of the attacking force) must be assigned to a separate
unit. Moreover, the duration of a combat, and, in conjunction
therewith, the necessity of reinforcing the firing line
and covering the flanks, increases with the size of the force.
During protracted periods of peace, one is too much inclined
to underestimate the wastefulness of a battle and the necessity
for reinforcing the fighting line; one cannot understand why
5 to 6 men will not suffice, during the course of a combat,
for a front wherein only one man can use his rifle. From the
foregoing it follows that the frontage does not increase in
proportion to the number of men. Thus, an army corps would
not occupy a front four times that of a brigade, or twice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page236">[236]</span>
of a division. This is best illustrated by doubling or trebling
a plane area when both length and breadth have to be equally
increased.<a id="FNanchor242" href="#Footnote242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The maximum frontage to be covered in attack by the
firing line of a <b>company</b> is fixed at 150 m., in order that the
density and fire power of that line may be constantly maintained
during a prolonged and costly action. During shorter
(<i>i.e.</i>, rear guard actions), or less costly actions (defense), it
is, however, permissible to exceed this limit. The regulations
by no means insist upon a literal interpretation of this paragraph,
since they mention the deployment of the entire company,
when it would certainly occupy a front of about 200 m.
There is no disguising the fact, however, that, when extended
on a front of 200 m., it is out of the question for the company
commander to lead his men.</p>

<p>The regulations do not fix the combat frontage of a
<b>battalion</b>, as it depends upon the tactical situation, and the
battalion commander is at liberty to place one, two, three, or
four companies into the first line. The frontage of a battalion
would thus be 300 meters when making an independent attack,
and not exceeding 600 meters when fighting a purely defensive
action as part of a larger force, in other words, a mean frontage
of 400 meters.</p>

<p>This is also true of the <b>regiment</b>. The combat frontage
of a regiment acting alone, will, at the start, seldom exceed
that of two battalions deployed abreast. From this we obtain
a frontage of 600-800 m. for the regiment when it is acting
independently, and a frontage of about 1200 m. when it is
fighting a purely defensive action as part of a larger force.</p>

<p>Military history tells us that an army corps consisting of
25 battalions, acting as a part of a larger force in a deliberately
planned attack, occupies an average front of 2.5 to 5 km. According
to this, the frontage of a brigade would amount to
about 800-1000 m., <i>i.e.</i>, to 6-7.5 rifles per meter of front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span></p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>This limit was frequently exceeded during the <b>Franco-German war</b>
according to the circumstances under which the brigade went into action
and the commander’s estimate of the situation. If the brigades had to
cover the concentration of the columns in rear, and if the battalions came
into action successively, both brigade and battalion frontages were frequently
very great. The endeavor to close with the enemy as soon as
possible and the desire to bring a large number of rifles into action, led to
enormously increased frontages at the expense of depth. The brigades
which arrived later, entered the line where other brigades were already
engaged, and the result was a dissolution and admixture of all tactical
organizations.</p>

<p>At <b>Colombey</b>, the 25th Brigade covered a front of nearly 3 km. with
28 companies, only four or five companies remaining in close order.
Connecting with this brigade on the north, 22 companies, belonging to
two different divisions of the 1st Army Corps, covered a front of 4 km.,
supported by three or four companies in close order. With such an overextension
of front the offensive or defensive power of a force is, of
course, crippled.</p>

<p>During the battle of <b>Amiens</b>, the 3rd Prussian Brigade advanced in
three columns against the heights north of the Luce. On the left, six
companies of the 4th Infantry advanced from Domart, in the center, four
companies from Hangard, and on the right, two companies from Demnin.
A battery and a troop (<i>Eskadron</i>) were attached to each column, and
the right column was followed by the 44th Infantry.</p>

<p>The French advanced troops were pushed back without special difficulty,
but at the northern edge of the timber, the brigade now found
itself opposite the French main position Cachy&mdash;Villers-Bretonneux. The
attack on this position began at once, and in a short time the 4th Infantry
and two batteries were in action on the line East corner of the Bois de
Hangard&mdash;Gentelles (5 km. long). At the same time, the 44th Infantry
with one battery deployed on a front of about 2000 m. to the right of
this line. The right wing of the 44th Infantry subsequently advanced to
attack the trenches southeast of Villers-Bretonneux and captured them.
The enveloped French left wing withdrew to the village named, and
rallied on strong reserves.</p>

<p>This was the situation when the fight came to a standstill toward
1 o’clock P. M. The brigade fought in a thin line over a mile (four
English miles) long. The reserve only consisted of three companies of
the 4th Infantry, at Gentelles, and four companies of the 44th Infantry, in
rear of the right flank.</p>

<p>A defeat was averted only by the timely interference of other troops,
especially of strong artillery (76 Prussian guns against 24 French).<a id="FNanchor243" href="#Footnote243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

<p>The frontage of a company is definitely fixed, so as to
make it easier for battalion and regimental commanders to
designate combat sections; the higher leaders reckon with regimental
and brigade fronts. In war, however, the numerical
strength varies constantly, and it is therefore advisable not to
reckon with companies, but with a corresponding number of
rifles (200 on an average). The combat frontages mentioned
in drill regulations only give an approximate idea of the extent
of front to be covered by organizations which act as part of
a larger force in an attack seeking a decision. The extent of
front to be covered in other situations, under favorable or unfavorable
attack conditions, requires in each case a separate
estimate.</p>

<p>In the Boer war, we notice for the first time overextensions
of front, which were undoubtedly caused by a desire to
avoid the costly frontal attack.</p>

<p>At Magersfontain, on December 11th, 1899, the British
division under Lord Methuen (7300 men) covered a front of
12 km.; and during the attack on Pieters Hill, on February
27th, 1900, the troops under General Buller (30,000 men) extended
over a front of 11 km.</p>

<p>At Poplar Grove, 7000 Boers with 7 guns fought on a
front of 17 km. (0.4 men per meter), while the British deployed
25,000 rifles, 5000 troopers, and 116 guns on a front of
32 km. (0.8 men per meter). In the engagement at Diamond
Hill, on June 11th, 1900, the army under Lord Roberts
(40,000 men) advanced on a front of 37 km. Such liberties
could be taken only in the face of a shaken enemy who had
given up all thoughts of the offensive. At Paardeberg, February
18th, 1900, the 6th Division and the Brigade of Highlanders
succeeded in getting close to the enemy, but there the
attack failed on account of the lack of an impetus from the
rear. Even in the Russo-Japanese war the frontages were
greater than those to which we are accustomed. The reason
for this overextension lies in the fact that a numerically inferior<span class="pagenum" id="Page239">[239]</span>
assailant was desirous of vanquishing the defender, and
in order to accomplish this purpose, he was obliged to make
an extensive use of the spade and to put all rifles into the
first line.</p>

<p>The realization that troops in fortified positions only require
small reinforcements or none at all, very naturally caused
frontages to be increased and depth of combat formations to
be decreased. Gaps in the attacking line, provided they were
kept under observation, proved by no means a disadvantage.<a id="FNanchor245" href="#Footnote245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote245" href="#FNanchor245" class="label">[245]</a> At Mukden, on March 3rd, 1905, there was a gap of 7 km. between the
Japanese IVth and Ist Armies, which was covered by only one infantry regiment
of Reservists, two dismounted cavalry regiments, and one battalion of artillery.
However, the Russians were fighting on the passive defensive in this case. The
insignificant danger to be apprehended from such gaps is especially emphasised
by the French regulations.</p>

<p>Let us now recapitulate the most important points which
have a bearing on combat frontage:</p>

<p>1. The frontage of individual units cannot be definitely
fixed, as it depends upon the situation and the purpose of an
action.</p>

<p>2. Favorable terrain, cover, and intrenchments permit an
extended front to be obstinately defended with a weak force.</p>

<p>3. The frontage does not increase in proportion to the
size of the force.</p>

<p>4. An organization (company, battalion, or regiment)
fighting as part of a larger force is justified in deploying on
a wider front than when acting alone.</p>

<p>The necessity for distribution in depth increases with the
size of the force and with the number of units composing it
Only the result can decide whether a narrow or a wide frontage
was justified in a given case. A commander will endeavor
to hold certain parts of the line with a weak force, posted in
groups, while, at the decisive point, he will throw in every
available man in order to gain the victory.</p>

<h5>Provisions of Various Regulations.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>Austria-Hungary.</b> Frontage depends upon the tactical situation and
the terrain. The frontage of a company acting as part of a larger force
in attack is fixed at about 130-150 paces (97-112 m.). “In other situations,
a greater frontage is, as a rule, permissible.” The battalion acting
as part of a larger force in attack, “is, as a rule, not to cover a frontage
exceeding its own front when in line”&mdash;in peace exercises, 300-400 paces
(225-300 m.). With companies of 200 men, 2 rifles, and in the battalion
2.6 rifles are reckoned per meter of front. “The increased fighting power
of infantry, due to better fire effect, in general permits a greater frontage
to be covered. This will often be taken advantage of, in order to make
as many troops as possible available for the decisive stage of the combat.
But this frontage should not be so great, that the requisite power of
resistance is weakened, or that tactical coöperation or the attainment of
the object of the combat are impaired.” Further than this nothing is
prescribed.</p>

<p><b>France.</b> Nothing definite is prescribed. The combat is carried on by
groups separated by intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span></p>

<p>“When <i>an organisation is acting as part of a larger force</i> and has to
advance directly to the front against a well-defined objective, its commander
may from the outset push a strong force into action, retaining a
reserve only in exceptional cases. If one of the flanks of this force is in
the air, it will be advisable to echelon units in rear of the flank which
may be threatened. When <i>an organisation is acting alone</i>, and when
both flanks are in the air, a weaker line is pushed forward and a reserve
is retained....”</p>

<p>The enhanced power of firearms permits an extended front to be
held, especially at the commencement of an action. The only restrictions
are those dictated by necessity&mdash;always to assure effective control by the
leader and mutual coöperation between the various tactical units.</p>

<p>This mode of fighting does away with continuous firing lines which
no longer fulfill the requirements of modern battle.</p>

<p><b>Belgium.</b> The frontage of a battalion acting as part of a larger force
in attack is fixed at 300 m.; in defense this is increased.</p>

<p><b>Japan.</b> The provisions of the Japanese regulations are identical
with those of the German regulations of 1889. The frontage of a company
is not given. A battalion may cover a frontage not exceeding that
of three companies. The frontage of a brigade, as a rule, does not exceed
1500 m. at the initial deployment.</p>

<p><b>Russia.</b> The frontage of a company, unless otherwise specified, is
governed by the object of the action, the terrain, and the effective strength,
and, as a rule, does not exceed 250 paces (180 m.). No figures are given
for the larger units.</p>

<p><b>England.</b> While great stress was laid upon narrow fronts and thin
firing lines prior to the Boer war, opinions swung to the opposite extreme
after that war. During a decisive attack, a battalion in the first line may
employ 125 rifles per 100 yards of front (<i>i.e.</i>, 90 m.), distributed as firing
line, supports, and battalion reserve; the latter may consist either of one
company or of parts of several. Entire companies are deployed only in
exceptional cases, for instance in terrain devoid of cover where it is difficult
to bring up reinforcements. The size of the reserve depends upon
the losses likely to be suffered by the fighting line. When these losses
will be small in all probability, the reserve may be as strong as the firing
line and the supports combined. In accordance with these general principles,
a battalion may deploy for attack on a front not exceeding 800
yds. = 720 m. (Formerly 540 m. was prescribed). A brigade consisting of
four battalions will thus be able to cover either a front of 1400 or one of
2100 m., depending upon the number of battalions put into the line.</p>

<p><b>Italy.</b> Only general principles are prescribed. “Skill in judging the
proper frontage to be covered by a force is attained in time of peace by
exercises on varied ground and under different situations, especially when
organizations approximately at war strength are used.”</p>

<h4 title="5. COMBAT ORDERS.">5. COMBAT ORDERS.<a id="FNanchor247" href="#Footnote247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote247" href="#FNanchor247" class="label">[247]</a> <span class="smcap">v. Kiesling</span>,
<cite>Gefechtsbefehle</cite>, Berlin, 1907.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Modern fire effect does not permit a commander to direct
the course of an action by despatching adjutants from time to
time. This must be borne in mind when issuing a combat
order. Such an order can only regulate the launching of the
troops into action and prescribe a task as a guide for their subsequent
conduct. Since leaders change during the course of
the combat, the order must ensure coöperation of the component
parts of the force by thoroughly explaining the purpose
of the fight. The troops have a right to know what the commander
expects of them; it is not sufficient to order them to
occupy a certain point&mdash;they must be told whether or not they
are to defend it. An order which directs troops “to oppose”
the enemy, conveys an extremely vague meaning; it should
specify instead whether they are “to attack” the enemy, or
whether they are “to defend” a position. The subordinate
leader’s pertinent question, as to the purpose of the combat,
forces the commander to indicate clearly whether he intends
to attack, or to stand on the defensive; whether he will fight
a delaying action, or avoid a decision by withdrawing. Even
the lowest grades must be informed of this decision of the
commander. The troops will perform anything that is demanded
of them in definite terms. On the other hand, the
commander must demand that no subordinate “hide” behind an
order and that, on the contrary, he act on his own initiative
when an order is not received or the situation changes.</p>

<p>Clearly defined sections of the battlefield (par. 475 German
I. D. R.) and definite combat tasks, each complete in
itself (par. 293 German I. D. R.), are assigned to the tactical
units to be employed in the first line (battalions in case of a
regiment; regiments, as a rule, in case of a division). In attack,
the order indicates the front upon which each one of the
larger units is to deploy and what portion of the hostile position<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
it is to attack. This demarcation defines the extent of
the combat sections (par. 371 German I. D. R.), within the
limits of which the particular unit must make the most of the
accidents of the ground. In carrying out these combat tasks,
unity of action is ensured by the mutual coöperation of the
tactical units fighting abreast of each other (par. 475 German
I. D. R.), and by the designation of a unit upon which the
others regulate their movements, without, however, thereby
being hampered in their endeavor to advance. (Base unit of
combat). Moreover, by employing his reserves, the commander
“can shift the decisive point of the action to any place
desired, reinforce where he deems it advisable, equalize fluctuations
of the combat, and, finally, bring about the decision.”</p>

<p>The first orders&mdash;those for putting the troops in motion
in the desired direction&mdash;are usually verbal; more detailed orders,
which are the rule from the brigade on up, are issued
subsequently. (Par. 274 German I. D. R.). In most cases,
the commander knows quite well what he wants, but only the
effort required in expressing in writing what he desires to say,
enables him to reproduce his thoughts with the necessary clearness.
Even in peace maneuvers, the officer who issued an order
and its recipients quite frequently disagree as to its interpretation;
the superior remembers only what he desired to say at
the particular moment, but not the language in which the order
was couched. Written orders minimize the possibility of a
misunderstanding. They have the further advantage that the
recipient has in his possession a document to which he can always
refer in case of doubt.</p>

<p>Orders should not provide for maintaining communication,
for protecting flanks, and for keeping up local reconnaissance,
since these matters are attended to as a matter of
course, every leader being held responsible for making proper
dispositions, within the limits of his command, for the performance
of these duties. The higher the rank of the commander,
the farther he should stay away from the scene of
battle. As the commander can exercise an influence on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>
course of the action only by employing his reserves, he should
remain near them, or, at any rate, retain their leader on his
staff. If the commander selects a position too close to the
point where the first line is engaged, he loses sight of the action
in its entirety, and allows himself to be influenced too much
by events within his immediate range of vision.<a id="FNanchor248" href="#Footnote248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The subordinate
commander, in selecting his position, has to consider
only good observation of the enemy, communication with
neighboring units, with the next higher commander, and with
his subordinates.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote248" href="#FNanchor248" class="label">[248]</a> This was true of Sir Redvers Buller at Colenso, and likewise of Kuropatkin.
The latter led in person too much and was completely lost in the details
of minor troop-leading.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>At headquarters, the work to be performed must be carefully
apportioned among the different members of the staff.</p>

<p>The commander, assisted by an officer of his staff, observes
the enemy and his own force, while another officer
maintains communication with the neighboring force and with
the next higher headquarters (signal flag squads, telephone),
and receives and prepares reports. (The scheme described
would be appropriate for a brigade staff, for example). It
is furthermore desirable to despatch information officers to
neighboring troops, and to detail officers from subordinate
units to receive orders.</p>

<p>The detailing of adjutants from subordinate units for the
purpose of facilitating the issue and despatch of orders of
higher headquarters is very properly prohibited by par. 83
German F. S. R.; on the march, this is permissible temporarily
only. The battalion supply officers will, however, frequently
be utilized as information officers, for, on the day of battle,
they would thus be most profitably employed.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In <b>France</b> this is regulated by <i>Agents de liaison</i>. These are to keep
the commander informed in regard to the special situation, the action of
subordinate units, and the intentions of their commanders. “The importance
of permanent communication between leader and subordinate increases
with the distances separating troops in action; the leader’s influence
on the course of the combat can be ensured only by these <i>agents</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span></p>

<p>As a general rule, one mounted officer from every infantry unit,
from the battalion up, reports to the next higher commander for the
purpose of maintaining communication. This officer may detail a cyclist
or trooper to accompany him. He is to be prepared to give all necessary
information in regard to his unit, and to keep in touch with the general
situation in order to inform his immediate superior in regard to it. He
communicates with his own unit either by sending orderlies with messages,
or by carrying the orders of the commander in person.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<h4>6. COMMUNICATION ON THE BATTLEFIELD.</h4>

<p>Cyclists and mounted messengers can be employed on the
battlefield only when the conditions are exceptionally favorable;
even intrenched connecting posts communicating with
one another by means of shouts or signals do not absolutely ensure
communication in a protracted engagement. Heliographs
or signal lamps are valuable only during the approach to the
battlefield and in large battles.<a id="FNanchor249" href="#Footnote249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> The same is true of the field
telegraph, by means of which, for example, division headquarters
may be connected with the headquarters of the corps.
In an infantry combat, only the field telephone, wig-wag flags,<a id="FNanchor250" href="#Footnote250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
and signal flags can be used. The employment of telephone
and telegraph has the advantage of ensuring greater quiet at
headquarters, since the coming and going of messengers is
eliminated; on the other hand, the commander is at once informed
of every reverse (which may perhaps be only temporary)
and will not always be able to resist the temptation of
leading subordinate commanders by apron strings. The Japanese
made a very extensive use of the various means of communication,
but neglected to guard against an interruption of
their lines of information by installing signal flag stations.
This cannot be dispensed with. In the Japanese army visual
signals<a id="FNanchor251" href="#Footnote251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
were not used, and in the Russian army they were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
adopted until October 4th, 1904. Thus means of communication
did not develop beyond the rudimentary stage in both
armies. According to all previous experience, telephone lines,
as now operated, are practicable in attack only for the purpose
of establishing communication down to brigade headquarters.<a id="FNanchor252" href="#Footnote252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>In defensive positions, which are held for a prolonged period, it is, of
course, practicable to establish telephonic connection with the most advanced
line. This was, for example, the case in the Japanese 10th Division on the
morning of March 3rd, 1905 (Mukden). On this occasion the division commander
in rear was informed by telephone of the presence of wire entanglements
in front of the Russian position, and permission was asked and granted
to postpone the attack.</p>

<p>Until recently, both signal and wig-wag flags were used
in Germany.<a id="FNanchor253" href="#Footnote253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The signal motions are made in an upright position,
the Morse code, which is rather difficult to learn, being
used. This method of signaling permits communication to be
kept up within a radius of 7 km.; moreover, it can be used
at night and in combined land and naval operations. The wig-wag
signals are easily learned and entirely sufficient for communicating
over distances within 3 km.; they also permit information
to be despatched rapidly, as abbreviations are employed
for certain frequently recurring movements. These signals
possess the additional advantage that they can be made
by a man while in a prone position.<a id="FNanchor254" href="#Footnote254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Wig-wag signals are a
very effective means of communication and will rarely fail.<a id="FNanchor255" href="#Footnote255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote254" href="#FNanchor254" class="label">[254]</a> Signals with wig-wag flags can be made by a man lying flat on his belly
or on his back; this is, however, frequently impossible with outstretched arms
and the sender must be content to make the signals by grasping the staves of
the two flags in the middle, then placing them in appropriate position relative
to each other (for example in making the letters, d, e, k, l, p, u).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote255" href="#FNanchor255" class="label">[255]</a> The signals prescribed in par. 11 German I. D. R. are very effective if
made with wig-wag flags; if made with signal flags they require constant
observation, without, however, precluding mistakes. For example, when given
with signal flags, the signal “halt” - “h, h, h,” (.... .... ....) is frequently
confused with the signal “the assault is about to begin” (... ... ...). This
mistake is not so apt to occur when wig-wag flags are used.</p>

<p>When General Stakelberg, after his right flank had been turned at Wafangu,
sent orders to withdraw to General Gerngross, the commander on the left
flank, it took the officer who carried the order through this mountainous
country, nearly an hour to cover the 5 km. which separated the two commanders.
An order sent by means of wig-wag flags could have reached the leader in question
within a few minutes.</p>

<p>A commander should not exercise a constant influence on
his subordinates just because modern means of communication
permit him to do so, as this would destroy all initiative and
independence. The permanent communication to which we
are accustomed in time of peace, and the method of leading
produced thereby, do not allow real qualities of leadership and
initiative to develop. It is unquestionably not easy for a commander
to refrain from interfering when a deployment does
not progress with sufficient rapidity or not in accordance with
his wishes.<a id="FNanchor256" href="#Footnote256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<h4>7. LOCAL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE INFANTRY.<br />
<span class="nonbold">(Pars. 305, 319, 355, 363 and 376 German I. D. R.).</span></h4>

<p>It is a strange fact that, while splendid work was done in
strategic reconnaissance in the large maneuvers of recent years,
not only in Germany but also in France, the local, tactical
reconnaissance was less good and often deficient, so that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span>
consequence thereof surprises were not rare. Frequently a gap
occurred in the reconnoitering line when the cavalry in front
of the various parts of the army was brushed aside and the
stronger cavalry force deprived the weaker of the freedom
of choosing its line of retreat. Occasionally, when this happened,
cavalry patrols were sent out with orders to report directly
to the infantry, or, at any rate, to find the hostile route
columns, but this expedient was only partially successful. It
must be remembered that troopers cannot ride close enough to
the enemy to see anything of importance, and that they frequently
are in ignorance of the very things which are of value
for the infantry. In addition, the divisional cavalry is entirely
too weak to perform all the tasks assigned to it. Therefore
infantry and artillery should not rely upon cavalry reconnaissance.
The mere fact that infantry has sent out cavalry patrols
in a certain direction does not relieve it from the duty of providing
for its own reconnaissance.</p>

<p>The greatest obstacle to infantry reconnaissance lies in
the fact that its cyclists are confined to good roads; that its
mounted officers cannot be withdrawn from their appropriate
duties except for short periods; that, as a rule, orderlies are
not available for carrying messages; and that, if officers carry
messages in person, the reconnaissance is interrupted. Infantry
patrols, on account of the slowness of their movements, cannot
transmit messages quickly, and, as a result, such messages
frequently arrive too late to be of any value. On the other
hand, infantry patrols possess an advantage in that, by utilizing
cover, they can get close to the enemy without being observed.
The need of local reconnaissance is greater now than
it was in the past, because troops can no longer change front
when deployed, and because those which come under hostile
fire while in close order formations may, in a short time, suffer
well-nigh annihilating losses.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In the South African war the British infantry was frequently placed
in difficult situations by the suddenly delivered fire of the Boers (<b>Magersfontain</b>,
<b>Colenso</b>), which induced it to deploy all of its lines on a wide
front at an early moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span></p>

<p>The Japanese attached much importance to local reconnaissance, whereas
the Russian leaders considered it as something unusual, so that Kuropatkin
was finally obliged to prescribe it in army orders. “Local reconnaissance
was performed by 20 to 30 infantrymen. These carefully approached
our positions in small groups. One man of each group laid his
rifle aside and crawled close up to our trenches, raised his head and
observed, while three or four of his companions, whom he had left farther
in rear, opened fire on the trenches. Occasionally all of these men threw
themselves flat on the ground for protection. This mode of procedure continued
for seven hours.”</p>

<p>The thoroughness of the reconnaissance generally made a timely
deployment possible, even when the enemy was well concealed, but that
neglects occurred nevertheless is borne out by the advance of the Japanese
2nd Division at <b>Fuchau</b> and <b>Kapukai</b> on March 10th, 1905. This division
advanced without reconnoitering, struck the fortified Russian position,
was unable to move forward or to the rear, and had to fight under unfavorable
conditions, and while suffering heavy losses, from early morning
until 4 P. M., when the general situation compelled the enemy to evacuate
the position. The advance of the Russian 54th Division (Orlof) during
the battle of <b>Liao Yang</b> (2nd Sept.) is a similar example of disproportionately
greater importance and with a tragic ending. The noise of the
battle at <b>Sykwantun</b> caused the commander of the 54th Division to leave
the position assigned him on the heights of the <b>Yentai</b> mines and to march
toward the sound of the cannonading. The division, advancing over
covered terrain without adequate reconnaissance, was taken in flank and
rear by the Japanese 12th Brigade (Sasaki),<a id="FNanchor258" href="#Footnote258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> and thrown back in utter
rout upon its former position, carrying with it the troops which had been
left there. Thus the Yentai heights fell into the possession of the Japanese.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The primary object of local reconnaissance is to protect
a force from surprise. This may be accomplished by sending
out combat patrols, and by company commanders riding ahead
in time. (Par. 457 German I. D. R.). The latter are likewise
charged with picking out avenues of approach to selected fire
positions, and the sooner they begin the reconnaissance the
better, for the accidents of the ground can then be utilized to
the best advantage.</p>

<p>The difficulties of the reconnaissance are increased when<span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span>
we have to reckon with the measures taken by the enemy to
screen his force.<a id="FNanchor259" href="#Footnote259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote259" href="#FNanchor259" class="label">[259]</a> The attacker’s reconnaissance must be prevented as long as possible.
Frequently patrols in the foreground will suffice for this purpose. (Par. 406
German I. D. R.)</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Weak infantry patrols can neither break down this resistance
nor create the necessary opening through which the
leaders can reconnoiter in person. Stronger forces are requisite,
and “reconnaissance companies” may have to be sent out
toward the enemy to serve as a support for the patrols, to reinforce
them when necessary, and to constitute natural collecting
stations for messages. “Reconnaissances in force” are the result
of these endeavors to obtain information,<a id="FNanchor260" href="#Footnote260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> for the defender
will not reveal his dispositions unless the attacker threatens an
attack. Reconnaissances in force are especially appropriate in
this case, since the information obtained in regard to the position
and strength of the enemy can be utilized at once. (Par.
134 German F. S. R.).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote260" href="#FNanchor260" class="label">[260]</a> See <cite>Taktik</cite>, IV. p. 214, et seq. The results of the reconnaissance in force
made at Neuville aux Bois were very unsatisfactory.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In France great importance is attached to forcibly gaining
information by means of detachments of all arms which
also prevent hostile reconnaissance. In minor operations the
French send out infantry detachments, which, from secure
hiding places, pick off observers, screen the position of their
own force, and prevent the enemy from using covered avenues
of approach. However, these very patrol combats may cause
the commander to come to a false conclusion in regard to the
hostile position. If the cavalry reconnaissance has determined
that the enemy intends to accept battle within a particular area,
the details of his intentions must be obtained by local reconnaissance.
Then the commander will wish to know whether
or not an immediate attack is feasible, or whether it is advisable
to wait until nightfall for bringing up the infantry.
The local reconnaissance determines where the flanks of the
enemy are located; whether the position in front is the hostile
main position or only an advanced post; whether the enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span>
has made preparations for defense; and where the hostile artillery
is posted. As a rule, it will be impossible, until after the
engagement has begun, to recognize a skillfully located fortified
position,<a id="FNanchor261" href="#Footnote261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> to distinguish between the real and dummy trenches,
determine the position of obstacles and estimate whether they
can be surmounted with or without adequate apparatus. Then
it likewise becomes necessary to find and mark covered avenues
of approach.<a id="FNanchor262" href="#Footnote262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> In moving to new firing positions, it is important
that advanced positions, masks, and dummy trenches be recognized
in time. The commander of a unit on a flank should
make dispositions for observation on his flank, and for permanent
communication with neighboring units, even though no
specific orders have been received by him to that effect. Strange
as it may seem, the troops deployed on the road Gorze&mdash;Rezonville
(battle of Vionville), by their failure to get into
early communication with the troops which had been on the
ground for some time, neglected to take advantage of the information
gained by those troops.<a id="FNanchor263" href="#Footnote263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<span class="smcap">Hoppenstedt</span> (<cite>Schlacht der Zukunft</cite>, pp. 134 and 140) draws a graphic
picture which is a faithful reproduction of reality.</p>

<p>The procedure outlined by that author (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 122) for indicating, by
means of flag signals, points sheltered from hostile fire, seems practicable. He
states: “Holding his flag upright, the member of the patrol proceeds steadily
on his way to Weyer. Now he has arrived at the point where the road bends
slightly toward the south; his flag descends,” etc.</p>

<span class="smcap">Kunz</span>, <cite>Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele</cite>, 8-9, p. 128, et seq., p. 243.</p>

<p>The necessity for thorough reconnaissance is illustrated by the successful
“fire surprises” carried out by the Boers at Modder River on November 28th,
1899, and at Colenso, against Hart’s Brigade advancing in dense masses, on
December 15th, 1899.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The enumeration of these tasks shows that local reconnaissance
should not be restricted to the preparatory stage of
the combat alone, but that it must be kept up during the whole
course of the action. To the duties enumerated, we may add,
occasional tasks, such as picking off staffs and signal men;
sneaking up on artillery that has been incautiously pushed forward;
and annoying the enemy by flanking fire. For such
tasks, so-called “scouting detachments,”<a id="FNanchor264" href="#Footnote264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
after the Russian pattern,<span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span>
have frequently been recommended. Their usefulness in
difficult country and in operations against the enemy’s flank
and rear cannot be denied. In minor operations, if provided
with ample ammunition and advancing on side roads, they can
hamper the reconnaissance of the enemy, secure the flanks of
their own force, ascertain the probable extent of the prospective
battlefield, and finally, having made a skillful lodgment,
they can become very annoying to the hostile artillery. In a
large battle the necessary elbow room for such employment is
lacking. To form picked men into special organizations, as is
done in Russia, is always of doubtful value. The constant
transfer of their best men to the mounted infantry during the
second part of the South African war was fatal to the British
infantry battalions. An organization cannot dispense with its
good men; it needs them to replace wounded non-commissioned
officers. While everything goes without a hitch, the withdrawal
of good men from an organization is of little importance;
the drawbacks to this procedure become apparent,
however, when the line begins to waver, when, in the absence
of officers, only the example of the courageous men prevents
the weak-kneed from running away. Our regulations properly
appreciate the importance of psychological impressions during
critical combat situations; they state: “The man who feels
his courage and coolness going, in the excitement of battle,
should look toward his officers. Should they have fallen, he
will find plenty of non-commissioned officers and brave privates,
whose example will revive his courage.” (Par. 268
German I. D. R.).</p>

<h4>8. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TERRAIN.</h4>

<p>The defense requires extensive, open terrain, permitting
unobstructed view, while the attack requires stretches of ground
hidden from the observation of the enemy and sheltered from
his fire, in order that the troops may be deployed for action
at the decisive ranges. A piece of ground will rarely possess
all these advantages, but, nevertheless, well-trained infantry
will be able to defend successfully a piece of ground that has a
poor field of fire, and infantry which is energetically and skillfully
led will be able to cross even an open plain.</p>

<p>At the longer ranges, a force will, in the first place, endeavor
to keep concealed. While advancing, troops will rarely
be able to take advantage of available cover, but at a halt and
while firing they will be able to do so. Their taking advantage
of the ground should not lead to a diminution of the energy of
the advance, and should not cause parts of the force to fall
behind.<a id="FNanchor268" href="#Footnote268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> “The terrain exerts considerable influence on the
formation of troops. Open country requires that distances be
increased so that the losses may be minimized, while close country<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
permits distances to be reduced. The commander should
take particular care not to let this advantage escape him, since
it is often necessary in this case to reinforce the first line
promptly. Close order formations may be retained longest on
covered terrain.” (Par. 307 German I. D. R.).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote268" href="#FNanchor268" class="label">[268]</a> This is equally true of ground that is difficult to march over; the troops
must cross it. The evasion of difficult portions of terrain usually leads to
disorder and a dispersion of the troops. For the advance of the 18th Infantry
Brigade at Wörth, see <span class="smcap">Kunz</span>, <cite>Kriegsgeschichtliche Beispiele</cite>, 14, p. 101. (Thick
underbrush in the woods on the Fuchshübel.)</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>An attack over a plain devoid of cover “should be avoided
as far as possible, or weak, widely extended detachments only
should be ordered to advance over it, while the bulk of the
force is launched at a point where an approach under cover
is practicable. If suitable terrain is lacking to permit this, then
the decisive attack must be led over the open plain.” (Par.
325 German I. D. R.). In contrast with the continuous skirmish
lines of the past, which are still favored by the Austrians,
the German regulations permit a gap to be left in the line
where an open plain devoid of cover exists, without thereby
implying that it cannot be crossed. The French regulations
(par. 257), contrary to the German, contemplate that “only
weak detachments be left in the open, fire swept spaces,” and
that the troops intended for the fire fight be pushed forward
under available cover, separate groups being thus formed.<a id="FNanchor269" href="#Footnote269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote269" href="#FNanchor269" class="label">[269]</a> This should be an important hint for the opponent. The lines of approach
may perhaps be sheltered with reference to a certain point, but there will always
be portions of the enemy’s line from which a fire may be directed upon these
avenues of approach and the troops marching thereon.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“This mode of fighting in groups does away with the continuous
firing lines of the past which no longer fulfill the requirements
of modern battle.</p>

<p>“The rearmost fractions of the force endeavor to avoid
open spaces, or such as are swept by hostile fire, by moving,
sometimes in a close order formation and again widely extended,
toward the lines of cover, without regard to the direction
in which the enemy may happen to be. The unit that
finds the advance easiest takes the lead, and all the others, supported
by the fire of their immediate neighbors, endeavor to
follow it.</p>

<p>“Depending upon the character of the terrain and available
cover, the forces deployed for the fire fight will, therefore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
advance in a rather dense formation in the areas favorable
for such a procedure, while weak forces only will be
found on open and fire swept ground. The advance is regulated
by designating the objective of the attack and by stipulating
the necessity of mutual coöperation.”</p>

<p>This French group attack owes its existence to the silently
accepted fact that an open plain cannot be crossed when swept
by unsubdued hostile fire; it reckons with an unfavorable terrain
such as an attacker will only find in exceptional cases.
We by no means fail to recognize the fact that individual portions
of the attacker’s force, when favored by the terrain, will
be able to advance more quickly than others, and that other
portions may even be compelled to discontinue their advance
for a time; but it seems a precarious proceeding to lay down
this result of the hostile fire effect as a guide in the training of
troops. The group tactics of the Boers stood the test only
on the defensive; they could not prevent individual groups
from being attacked by far superior forces. In an attack, the
units favored by the terrain will constitute the framework
upon which the units which are compelled to advance more
slowly, will form. There is, however, danger that these leading
groups will succumb to the superior fire of a defender who
is deployed on a broader front. Although this may not happen,
the spirit of the regulations tempts leaders to drive everything
forward, to rush ahead with isolated parts of the force.
An additional drawback of these systematic group tactics lies
in the difficulty of deploying the troops moving in the narrow
avenue of approach. If the French infantry really desires to
avoid the plain and wants to stick principally to cover, who
will guarantee that the great freedom allowed it, will not cause
it to crowd together under cover, lose the direction to its objective,
and become completely mixed up?<a id="FNanchor270" href="#Footnote270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> This danger is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
more imminent since no importance is attached to a more
definite limitation of the frontage to be covered, while wide extension
is, on the contrary, actually preached. The fear of
losses will gain the upper hand and the attack will lose its

<p>While the new German Infantry Drill Regulations do not
underestimate the difficulties of an advance over open ground,
they require that the march direction be maintained and that
cover be utilized only within the assigned “combat section”;
they leave it to subordinate commanders to choose suitable expedients
for crossing such unfavorable ground. “Within the
limits of the section assigned to an organization for an attack,
the plain devoid of cover should be avoided as far as possible,
or weak, widely extended detachments only should be ordered
to advance over it, while the bulk of the force is launched at a
point where an approach under cover is practicable. <i>If suitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span>
terrain is lacking to permit this, then the decisive attack must
be led over the open plain.</i>” (Par. 325 German I. D. R.).
For purposes of instruction, it is entirely correct to require
“that even on terrain devoid of cover, well-trained infantry
should not open fire until the medium ranges are reached.”
(Par. 326 German I. D. R.). The necessity, when under hostile
fire, of adapting movements to the accidents of the ground,
should not impair the energy of the advance and cause portions
of the attacking force to lag behind, thereby disintegrating
it. On the other hand, we should not be afraid to leave
gaps in our attacking line, as the enemy would, in any case, not
be able to use them for his own advance.</p>

<p>Thus we have here the German united attack, on the one
hand, and the French group attack, on the other. Since group
tactics no doubt diminish losses, they should be used in delaying
actions, in holding attacks, and in defense; they should
unquestionably not be employed when a concerted, rapid
movement of skirmishers to the front becomes necessary. How
should the Vth Corps at Wörth and the Guard at St. Privat,
for instance, have attacked, according to the French regulations?</p>

<h4>1. DEVELOPMENT OF THE ARM.</h4>

<p>The effect of canister had decreased considerably with
the introduction of rifled guns, and this was the more noticeable,
because, simultaneously therewith, the accuracy and rate
of fire of the infantry rifle was greatly increased. The attempts
to re-invest the artillery with its one-time superiority
were directed in two channels: one aimed at perfecting shrapnel,
which had been rather neglected up to this time (England,
Prussia, Austria), while the other resurrected the mediaeval
idea of the “barrel-organ gun,” with a view of assembling
a number of rifle barrels and of combining thereby the accuracy
of the small arm with the moral effect of canister. Thus,
among others, the 4-10 barreled <i>Gatling</i> gun was invented in
America in 1861, it being the oldest representative of this type
of weapon. In order to obtain a weapon matching the Prussian
<i>needle</i> gun, Bavaria adopted the 4 barreled <i>Feldl</i> gun and
France the 25 barreled <i>mitrailleuse</i>.<a id="FNanchor274" href="#Footnote274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> The name <i>canon à balles</i>,
which was given the gun, sufficed to indicate the manner in
which it was intended to be used. As these guns frequently
failed in action, offered the same target and required the same
equipment and approximately the same road space as field<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
guns, the states who had first adopted them, finally decided to
dispense with them on European theaters of war. The further
development of machine guns was not especially accelerated
by the fact that the French <i>mitrailleuses</i> had not fulfilled
the expectations entertained for them during the Franco-German
war, isolated cases excepted,<a id="FNanchor275" href="#Footnote275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and that they were quickly
silenced by the German artillery, which was equipped only with
percussion shell, as soon as their position was ascertained.
Thus, these guns seemed useful only in colonial wars and on
board war ships for warding off torpedo boats. Although they
took up very little room when in position, they were not considered
useful for flank defense in fortresses, on account of
the frequent breakdowns. In addition to their height, other
defects developed; for example, they could obtain only a very
insignificant rate of fire, betrayed their position by the powder
smoke, and lacked the means for ascertaining ranges.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote274" href="#FNanchor274" class="label">[274]</a>
The 25 barreled <i>mitrailleuse</i>, cal. 13 mm., fired volleys at the rate of 125
rounds per minute. Its fire was considered equivalent to that of 50 needle guns;
its weight was 1,485 kg., each of its four horses pulling 371 kg.; its maximum
range was 3,000 m. Its most favorable, practical range 500-1,500 m.&mdash;A glaring
defect of the gun was that fire pauses occurred whenever cartridges were fed
into the slot and that the lateral spread of its cone of dispersion was extremely
small.</p>

defense of the plateau of Auvours. (<cite>Revue d’artillerie</cite>, 1900, p. 297; <cite>Gen. St.
W.</cite>, IV, p. 817).</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The situation changed entirely when a practicable, smokeless
powder was invented, and Hiram Maxim, an American,
succeeded in utilizing the energy of the recoil (a factor neglected
up to that time, although annoying to the marksman)
for opening the breech, inserting a fresh cartridge into the
chamber, closing the breech, and automatically firing the
piece.<a id="FNanchor276" href="#Footnote276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Through this invention it became possible to fire a
maximum of 900 and an average of 500 rounds per minute,
from a single barrel moving laterally back and forth. The
desire to obtain a still greater rate of fire was checked effectively,
because of the fact that with such an increase the danger
of jamming increased and the use of infantry ammunition was
precluded. The water in the jacket continues to be a decided
drawback to this type of gun, for it is not always easily procured,
impairs the mechanism by freezing, makes it difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span>
change barrels, and constitutes a considerable weight. If cooling
the barrel by means of water were to be dispensed with, the
accuracy of the piece would rapidly diminish, and, after 1000
rounds of continuous fire, bullets would tumble even at short
ranges. At the present time water is still the most effective
means of cooling the barrel.<a id="FNanchor277" href="#Footnote277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote276" href="#FNanchor276" class="label">[276]</a>
Of the other types the following may here be mentioned: <i>Hotchkiss</i>
(France), insufficient cooling of the barrel by air; <i>Schwarzlose</i> (Austria),
machine gun model 7, a very simple weapon which has only a single spring.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote277" href="#FNanchor277" class="label">[277]</a>
In the <i>Colt</i> Machine Gun, which is not water-cooled, after 500 rounds had
been fired, a cartridge inserted into the piece exploded in seven seconds, and
cartridges placed in the chamber a quarter of an hour later exploded in 20
seconds.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Machine guns fire ordinary small arms ammunition carried
in loops on a canvass belt (weighing 1 kg. when empty),
which is generally capable of holding 250 rounds of 8 mm.
cartridges weighing 8.315 kg. These belts are very carefully
manufactured, the material being shrunk, so as to prevent their
shrinking when in use. Two men can refill an empty belt
with 8 mm. cartridges in seven minutes, according to Swedish
experiments, while a belt filling machine can refill one in a
still shorter time. The rate of fire of machine guns is approximately
500 rounds per minute. They are variously mounted,<a id="FNanchor278" href="#Footnote278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
according to circumstances, on sleds (in which the gun rests
on a frame similar to that of a wheelbarrow), on tripods, or,
for mountain warfare, on basket frames. Although the greatest
readiness for firing was obtained with guns mounted on
cavalry carriages (two-wheeled carts, similar to limbers, and
equipped with shafts), which also permitted the greatest
amount of ammunition to be carried along, these guns offered
such a high target that their use, in an infantry action, was
entirely out of the question, leading only to their being quickly
silenced. Another defect was that the guns were unable to
follow immediately upon the heels of the organization to
which they were attached. Guns mounted on light tripods
possess the least readiness for firing, as the gun must be dismounted
during each change of position; but tripods are indispensable<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
in mountain warfare. In India a tripod frame on
wheels is employed. The basket frame, which is very light and
is carried on the back of a soldier, affords nothing but a rest
for the gun. This type of mount has the disadvantage of
necessitating, in reality, freehand firing when the barrel is
supported near the muzzle; that the operator, when firing continuously,
becomes greatly fatigued, and that the accuracy suffers
in consequence thereof. The advantages of the tripod
and the wheeled carriage have been skillfully combined in the
carriage adopted in Germany. In this the gun rests on a sled;
this is in turn supported by the carriage proper, which is
wheeled. In exceptional cases the gun may be fired from the
carriage, but ordinarily it is fired from the sled, which is detached
from the carriage for that purpose. This sled permits
the gun to be laid at any desired height and enables it to follow
the infantry anywhere during an action.<a id="FNanchor279" href="#Footnote279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>In the Russo-Japanese war the machine gun detachments of the Russian
cavalry were equipped with <i>Rexer</i> guns which can scarcely be considered machine
guns owing to their slow rate of fire and extreme heating of the barrel.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Machine guns can be transported upon larger vehicles
capable of being unlimbered; they can also be carried on pack
horses or other pack animals, and for short distances by men.
Although pack animal transportation enables the guns to follow
the troops anywhere, the amount of ammunition that can
be carried along is limited, and the opening of fire is retarded,
since gun and tripod must first be assembled; the opening
of fire may even be delayed when a pack animal falls; ammunition
cannot be carried on the gun; and the animals get sore
backs even if pack saddles are carefully adjusted.</p>

<h4>2. THE POWER OF MACHINE GUNS.</h4>

<p>The machine gun is noted for its adaptability to any terrain,
and the constancy of its high rate of fire as compared
with that of a body of infantry, which decreases with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span>
range, the diminishing visibility of the target, and prolonged
fire. On the other hand, a single jamming can make a machine
gun valueless, at least for the time being. For this reason,
the Germans employ machine guns only in platoons, as
a rule, and the Swiss let both guns of a platoon fire simultaneously
only in exceptional cases. Theoretically, the maximum
rate of fire of 600 rounds per minute will rarely be attained;
and 200-300 rounds per minute will usually suffice
against prone targets. In Germany volley and continuous fire
are employed; fire by a single piece is used only to ward off
patrols when the machine guns do not want to betray their
position.<a id="FNanchor280" href="#Footnote280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote280" href="#FNanchor280" class="label">[280]</a> The following kinds of fire are used in the countries named below:</p>

<p>Austria: Single shots; volleys (20-25 rounds); fire by a single piece.</p>

<p>Switzerland: Fire by a single piece; volleys (20-30 rounds); rapid fire
(volleys of 100 rounds); and fire at will (both pieces of a platoon simultaneously
employing rapid fire). The last-named is only employed in exceptional cases,
for example, when the danger is imminent and when favorable opportunities
offer.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A volley consists of about 25 rounds and is followed by
a pause for observing the effect of the fire. It is employed
in adjusting the fire upon difficult targets in rolling country.
Fire for effect consists, as a general rule, of “continuous fire,”
and is interrupted only when the tactical situation requires it.
The water in the jacket should be renewed and oiling attended
to during the pauses in the fire, whether these grow out of
the tactical situation, or are made necessary by technical considerations.</p>

<p>The fire is either directed upon a point (concentrated
fire), the elevation and direction of the piece being fixed, or it
is distributed over the entire target or over a designated part
of the same (sweeping, and progressive fire).<a id="FNanchor281" href="#Footnote281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote281" href="#FNanchor281" class="label">[281]</a> For example, when sweeping the crest of the parapet of a line of trenches,
or the edge of a wood, both hands move the gun slowly and evenly from side to
side. When searching an area in the direction of depth and obliquely (progressive
fire with sweeping), the left hand gives the gun the proper horizontal
direction, while the right manipulates the slow motion elevating gear. When
firing on rapidly moving targets&mdash;for example skirmish lines advancing by
rushes&mdash;or targets advancing over rolling country, both the traversing and
elevating movements may be unclamped. The rapidity with which the gun is
moved, when sweeping or searching, depends upon the range and the kind of
target on which the fire is directed. As a rule, the piece is moved slowly and
steadily. The accuracy of the fire is impaired when the gun is moved too rapidly.
When the fire is well observed, it might be advantageous, in exceptional cases,
when firing against either stationary or moving targets, to direct the gun, without
aiming, after the bullets have been seen to hit their mark, by properly
manipulating the elevating and traversing apparatus while the firing is in
progress.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span></p>

<p>The ballistic properties of the gun are the same as those
of the infantry rifle.<a id="FNanchor282" href="#Footnote282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote282" href="#FNanchor282" class="label">[282]</a> The destructive power of the projectiles fired from a machine gun, as they
strike within a small space, is, of course, much greater than that of the
scattered projectiles of a body of infantry. Trees having a circumference of 30
cm. are felled by machine gun fire in about 15 seconds at a range of 450 m.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In the machine gun an important factor in the dispersion
of infantry fire&mdash;flinching and errors in aiming&mdash;is eliminated,
while the heating of its barrel and the vibrations of its
carriage in continuous fire do not produce a corresponding increase
in dispersion. On this account the cone of dispersion of
the machine gun is more compact than that of the infantry
rifle and its accuracy at long ranges is therefore considerably
greater than that of the latter.<a id="FNanchor283" href="#Footnote283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Firing tests indicate that the
accuracy of machine gun fire diminishes only very slightly
with increasing range, provided the appropriate elevation is
used.<a id="FNanchor284" href="#Footnote284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote283" href="#FNanchor283" class="label">[283]</a> According to Austrian experiments the depth of the beaten zone of a

<p>In war the influence of the compact cone of dispersion
will be still more potent, for we will then have to reckon with
a single, specially selected machine gun marksman who is
well protected, while the excitement of battle will produce a
far different impression upon an organization composed of
men differing materially from each other. The compactness<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>
of the cone of dispersion of the machine gun requires that the
appropriate elevation be used if the fire is to be effective
against well concealed prone skirmishers. This can be accomplished
only in part by employing range finders. Since the
probable error of these instruments is ±5% of the range, this
determination is so inaccurate for machine gun fire that nothing
remains but to increase the dispersion artificially. When
it is impossible to observe the strike of the bullets, the dispersion
may be artificially increased by employing combined
sights, two in a single platoon and three in a machine gun
battery (company), and above all by sweeping. The employment
of combined sights would appear to be too rigid a method;
sweeping fire is at any rate better.<a id="FNanchor285" href="#Footnote285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>From this it follows that the good qualities of the machine
gun can be utilized to the fullest advantage only when
the appropriate elevation is used. When this is not accurately
known, the fire effect of the machine gun drops down to zero
more quickly than that of a skirmish line. Where local conditions
are at all favorable, the determination of the appropriate
elevation is facilitated by observing the strike of the
projectiles in “volley fire.”</p>

<p>It is clearly apparent that the permissible error of the
range finder is smaller than the depth of the vertical dispersion
strip covered by 75% of the bullets.</p>

<p>The difficulty of hitting a target lodged in some feature of
the terrain requires that the machine gun be used first of all
against large targets that are visible for a short time only.
When the appropriate elevation is used, a decisive effect may
be confidently counted on within a short space of time; when
an inappropriate elevation is used and the fire is not properly
observed, only accidental hits can, as a rule, be expected, even
when the fire is directed on tall, dense targets. When the fire
is directed on skirmishers lying down, the effect produced is
not commensurate with the amount of ammunition expended,
and a slight error in the elevation used may nullify the effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span>
entirely. A straight line of trenches, which is plainly visible,
is, on the other hand, an eminently favorable target. The
heating of the barrel, and the difficulty of replenishing ammunition
and renewing the water in the jacket, tend to work
against a participation of machine guns in a protracted fire
fight. The machine gun is not at all suited for carrying on a
prolonged fire action.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to determine the relative combat value
of a body of infantry as compared with that of a machine gun.
One will not be far wrong in placing this value between 50 and
60 men.</p>

<p>In experimental field firing at the Swiss Infantry Musketry
School, it was demonstrated that 30-40 skirmishers
almost in every case rapidly gained the upper hand over a
machine gun in the open, at 900 m., but that the infantrymen
had small chances of success when the position of the machine
gun could not be accurately determined. In Switzerland
a machine gun is considered equivalent to 50 infantrymen.
Skirmishers are the most difficult target for machine guns to
fight, and, at the same time, they are the most dangerous.
When the fire is well observed, a good effect can, indeed, still
be counted on, when the fire is directed at prone skirmishers
at ranges up to 1000 m., but this is not true when the fire cannot
be observed; in the last mentioned case, no effect worth
mentioning is produced.</p>

<h4>3. INFANTRY VERSUS MACHINE GUNS.</h4>

<p>It will rarely be possible to concentrate upon a machine
gun battery of six guns a fire equivalent to its own. Because
of the small target offered by machine guns, it is necessary for
a firing line to concentrate its fire upon one machine gun at a
time, thus gradually silencing the battery in detail. This procedure
is feasible because it is very difficult for the machine
guns to reach with their fire all parts of a well concealed skirmish
line. The normal relation, unfavorable for the infantry,
changes in its favor, however, as machine guns cannot keep
up a high rate of fire for a prolonged period, even when nothing
is considered but ammunition supply; as serious breaks are
especially apt to occur when the gun is worked to its maximum
capacity; and as the ammunition expended in one minute
(3600 rounds) cannot produce an effect unless not only the
correct range but also the proper elevation is accurately
known.</p>

<p>The fight against machine guns may be advantageously
conducted according to the following principles:<a id="FNanchor288" href="#Footnote288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>1. Infantry skirmishers should conceal themselves so
well that it will be difficult for the hostile machine gun battery
to find them. Color of immediate vicinity (shade) and background
should be considered; platoon and other leaders must<span class="pagenum" id="Page269">[269]</span>
not stand upright; objects that are clearly visible should be
avoided.</p>

<p>2. It should be made difficult for the hostile machine
guns to observe their fire (ricochets) and to measure the range.
(No prominent features that would facilitate such measurements
should be located near the infantry position).</p>

<p>3. The firing line, as far as this is possible, should not
be continuous; the several parts of the line should be posted
in echelon.</p>

<p>4. Kinds of fire: Lively fire at will should be used.</p>

<p>5. Expenditure of ammunition: At least 600 rounds
should be expended against each machine gun.</p>

<p>6. At the outset a single company should concentrate its
fire upon a single machine gun, picking out the one that is
most clearly visible. Machine guns on the flanks are not good
targets, as a strong wind may deflect the fire directed upon
them.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote288" href="#FNanchor288" class="label">[288]</a> Switzerland: Machine guns, “on account of their small gun squads, are
more sensitive to losses than artillery. They cannot adjust their fire so easily
as artillery, but, when once on the target, the effect of their fire is great.</p>

<p>“The principles governing the combat against artillery are applicable, in
general, to the fight against machine guns. It may be assumed that at medium
ranges, one platoon of infantry will suffice for silencing one machine gun,
provided the platoon of infantry fights the action under favorable conditions.
At short ranges, a few good marksmen suffice for silencing a machine gun.
For this reason selected men are sent forward, when the situation permits, to
sneak up to the machine guns and to pick off the men serving them.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The following rules, governing the conduct of infantry
when exposed to machine gun fire, may be deduced from the
above:</p>

<p>Even skirmish lines cannot continue their advance over
terrain devoid of cover, when exposed within a range of 1500
m. to the unsubdued fire of machine guns; nothing remains but
for them to lie down, and to gain ground to the front in
groups, or one by one.</p>

<p>The same is true of route columns. They can only deploy
to the right and left front at double time, and take cover.</p>

<p>The most unsuitable formation under machine gun fire
is the column of platoons, whether lying down or in motion.<a id="FNanchor289" href="#Footnote289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote289" href="#FNanchor289" class="label">[289]</a>
Within <sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> to 1 minute a column of platoons (lying down) sustained an
average of 4.22% hits at 1400 m. and 4.31% hits at 900-1100 m. with 42 and
32%, respectively, figures placed out of action.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>If the column of platoons is reached by effective machine
gun fire, when lying down, line must be formed. The men
must not rise, however, to execute this movement, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span>
platoons should crawl forward into line. For the men to rise
would mean annihilation.</p>

<p>The low target offered by machine guns makes them a
difficult target for field artillery to hit, in spite of the accuracy
with which the latter can adjust its fire.</p>

<h4>4. MACHINE GUNS IN GERMANY.</h4>

<p>The German machine gun (drawn by 4 horses driven
from the saddle) is mounted upon a sled which forms the
firing frame. On the march, this sled is placed on a wheeled
carriage, from which it must first be detached (10-15 seconds)
before the gun is used; in exceptional cases, the gun can
be fired from the wheeled carriage.</p>

<p>The gun commander is mounted. Two of the gunners
are seated on the axle chest of the carriage, their carbines
buckled to the gun carriage; two are seated on the limber chest,
their carbines slung over their backs. When surprised by a
direct attack, all the men that can be spared form as skirmishers
in the intervals between the guns of the machine gun battery.
The machine gun can be served by a single man. The
water in the jacket need not necessarily be renewed when the
gun is fired for a short time only.</p>

<p>The machine guns can be used on any terrain passable
for infantry. When detached from the wheeled carriage they
can even surmount considerable obstacles. In action, they
present no larger target than skirmishers fighting under similar
conditions, and are capable of offering more resistance
than infantry.</p>

<p>The sled can be carried or drawn by the men for short
distances. The ammunition, placed in belts holding 250
rounds each, and packed in six boxes, is similarly drawn on
an ammunition sled. If the conditions permit, the guns may
be drawn by horses.</p>

<p>The “fighting battery” consists of six guns, formed into
three platoons, and an ammunition platoon (three ammunition
wagons and one store wagon); the combat train consists of
officers’ and other led horses. The field train consists of one
baggage wagon, one ration (commissary) wagon, one forage
wagon, and a second store wagon.</p>

<p>The movements and gaits of a machine gun battery are
the same as those of a field battery: the order in line, at close
or extended intervals, in which the guns are abreast, the intervals
between them, measured from center to center, being
5 and 17 paces, respectively. The order in line, at extended
intervals, is used in moving to the front or rear; the order in
line, at close intervals, for assembly, for movements in that
formation, for parking, and for parade. The section column<a id="FNanchor290" href="#Footnote290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
is the principal maneuver formation on the battlefield; it is
employed as an assembly formation on a road, and as route
column. (Par. 320 German F. S. R.). In section column
the guns follow each other at a distance of four paces. In
addition to this column, a column of platoons is used, in which
the platoons follow each other at a distance of 22 paces. (This
may be reduced to 6 paces).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote290" href="#FNanchor290" class="label">[290]</a> The guns are placed in rear of each other, the ammunition wagons and

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A machine gun battery has available 87,300 rounds of ammunition
(10,500 rounds with each gun and 8100 rounds in
each ammunition wagon, or a total of 14,550 rounds per gun),
which may be drawn forward to the firing position upon sleds,
in boxes holding 250 rounds each. The ammunition wagons
are refilled from the ammunition wagons of the light ammunition
columns of the cavalry division and from the wagons of
the infantry ammunition columns marked with a red stripe,
which carry ammunition for machine gun units. A reserve
machine gun is carried with the ammunition column.</p>

<p>The machine gun battery combines high infantry fire
power (approximately equivalent to that of the skirmishers of
a German cavalry regiment, armed with carbines, or to that of
4-6 platoons of infantry)<a id="FNanchor291" href="#Footnote291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> with instant readiness for firing,
and a mobility which enables it to follow the mounted arms
anywhere. The chance of producing a sudden fire effect within
a short space of time must be especially utilized, and, therefore,
an endeavor should be made to put entire machine gun batteries
into the first line. The employment of single guns is
precluded owing to the danger of breakdowns, and the employment
of platoons is especially proper on the defensive as well
as in action at short range.</p>

<p>The duties of machine guns naturally grow out of their
tactical advantages. Their fire power should be saved for decisive
moments, when the development of strong fire power
at short ranges is requisite, and when the available time and
the situation do not permit of pushing infantry into action.
The machine gun batteries, which constitute an independent
arm, and which are assigned to cavalry and infantry divisions,
are best adapted for these duties.</p>

<p>The heavy matériel and the teams designed for rapid
movements make the machine gun battery less suited for employment
in infantry combat, where such a high degree of mobility
is not so necessary. In the battle on the Shaho an employment
of machine guns by platoons in the first line, came
about quite naturally. The guns prepared the assault, reinforced
weak points, and supported the advance. In Germany,
provisional machine gun companies consisting of six two-horse
machine guns, driven from the carriage (these guns cannot
be fired from their carriages), have been adopted for this purpose.
These machine gun companies are principally an auxiliary
weapon of the infantry, and, distributed by platoons to
the battalions, or sent into action as a single unit by the regimental
commander, they serve the purpose of augmenting the
fire of the infantry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page276">[276]</span></p>

<p>Movements at increased gaits are possible in exceptional
cases only; as a rule, the guns follow the infantry at a walk,
and in combats terminating in a defeat, it may frequently be
impossible to keep them from falling into the hands of the
enemy. The permanent assignment of machine guns to battalions
does not seem to be advisable.</p>

<h4>5. GOING INTO POSITION.</h4>

<p>The principles which govern the reconnaissance and occupation
of a position by field artillery are applicable also to machine
guns. The tactical situation determines whether the
guns should move into position under cover or in the open.
As a rule, the interval between two adjacent machine guns in
line is 17 paces; but the proper utilization of favorable cover
does not preclude posting the guns close together. It may likewise
be advantageous to post the guns in echelon on the flanks.</p>

<p>In action the carriages remain, as a rule, in the nearest
cover in rear of the line. The advance from this point is effected
by the men carrying or dragging the detached guns
and ammunition sleds; under certain circumstances, it may
also be advisable to have the guns or ammunition sleds drawn
forward by single horses (mounts of gun commanders). On
level ground the ammunition platoon and the wheeled carriages
of the machine guns take post in rear of and as close
as possible to the guns. Whether the two groups are combined,
or whether the machine gun carriages should occupy the nearest,
and the ammunition wagons the more distant cover, depends
upon the available cover. The commander of the machine
gun carriages sends full ammunition sleds to the firing
line at an early moment and has empty boxes and belts brought
back.</p>

<h4>6. THE FIRE FIGHT.</h4>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The machine gun. squad consists of one gun commander and four
gunners, numbers 1-4; number 2 is the gun pointer. The gun commander
sees that the gun is set up for the prone, sitting, or kneeling fire position,
according to the terrain, supervises the service of the gun, which can be
served in any position of the body, and removes all obstructions that interfere
with its effective use. The gun pointer handles the gun, <i>i.e.</i>, he loads
it, sets the sight, aims and fires it. No. 3, who lies to the right of the gun
pointer, assists the latter in these duties, places a box of ammunition on
the right of the gun, and feeds the ammunition belt into the slot. When
necessary, he takes the place of the gun pointer. No. 1 lies in rear of the
gun pointer, keeps his eye on the battery and platoon commanders, and
transmits their orders to the gun commander and gun pointer. No. 4 has
charge of the replenishment of ammunition; he takes cover or lies down
20 paces in rear of, or on a flank of the gun.</p>

<p>The range finders, without special orders to that effect, measure the
range to targets as they appear, or to fixed points, and call it out to the
battery commander. The battery commander designates the target, the
range, and the kind of fire to be used. The platoon commanders assign
a section of the target to each of their guns, designate the elevation that
is to be used, and supervise the service of the guns; they are especially
held responsible that the fire is directed upon the proper target. Platoon
commanders constantly observe through their field glasses the strike of
the bullets and the enemy. The commander of the gun carriages is
charged with their supervision; he constantly sends forward ammunition,
and, when necessary, men and matériel, into the firing position. When
the detached guns change position, he follows the movement under cover
with the gun carriages, bringing them as close to the firing position as
possible.</p>

<p>After machine gun batteries had been employed at maneuvers as an
auxiliary arm of the cavalry, they did especially good work in the fights
in Southwest Africa,<a id="FNanchor292" href="#Footnote292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> where they were not opposed by artillery.</p>

<p>Through their ability to follow a skirmish line into the densest thickets,
they were a valuable support to the infantry in the close country in
which the African fights took place, where artillery of necessity had to
fail owing to absence of a clear field of view. It was demonstrated, however,
that the machine gun squads became so engrossed in the work of
serving their guns that supporting troops had to guard them against
surprise.</p>

<p>In the engagement at the <b>Waterberg</b>, the machine guns did splendid
work in meeting, with an effective volley fire, the sudden, energetic
attacks made by the Hereros against the flank and rear of the Germans.<span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span>
In two critical moments, during the attack against the left flank of the
advance guard, and during the attack made with a yell against the
right and rear of headquarters, it was principally due to the machine
guns that the enemy, who had come within short range, was repulsed.
Participants of this fight believed that the Hereros did not dare to make
a real attack when machine guns went into action against them. It had
been impossible to avoid using single machine guns. Just as the enemy
was making an attack upon the 11th Company, machine gun No. 3 (2nd
Machine Gun Battery), which had done splendid work, broke down. This
was the only case of jamming that occurred. Although exposed to a
galling hostile fire, the gun commander managed to change barrels in 30
seconds, and then to resume the firing. The 2nd Machine Gun Battery
expended 20,775 rounds of ammunition; the expenditure of the different
guns varied between 7350 and 120 rounds, according to the part taken
by them in the action. The ammunition supply was certain and steady;
no shortage of ammunition, not even a temporary one, occurred anywhere.</p>

<h4>7. MACHINE GUNS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.</h4>

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>Switzerland.</b> In 1892 Switzerland began to organize four mounted
Maxim machine gun companies, which were assigned to the weak cavalry
brigades (consisting of six troops<a id="FNanchor293" href="#Footnote293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>) on account of the defensive role of
the Swiss cavalry and the lack of batteries of horse artillery. Three
machine gun companies were assigned to the fortifications on the St.
Gotthard and one to St. Moritz for the purpose of augmenting the fire
of the advanced positions belonging to those fortifications, and to cover
the approaches thereto.</p>

<p>A Maxim machine gun company consists of 6 officers, 105 non-commissioned
officers and privates, 99 horses (24 pack horses and 24 draft
horses), 8 guns mounted on tripods, and 7 vehicles (two of these are
two-horse supply and baggage wagons, one four-horse field forge with field
kitchen, 4 two-horse ammunition wagons, each carrying 15,520 rounds of
ammunition). The guns and the ammunition are carried on pack animals.
A packed gun horse carries a load of 108 kg. inclusive of 5 kg. of oats.
An ammunition horse carries a load of 123 kg. inclusive of 5 kg. of oats
and 8 ammunition boxes (each holding 250 rounds, or a total of 2000
rounds weighing 90.5 kg.). A machine gun company of eight guns is
divided into four platoons, each consisting of two guns and four ammunition
horses, and the combat train, consisting of four ammunition wagons
and the field kitchen. Every gun is commanded by a “gun chief,” and
two of the five men belonging to the gun squad are horse holders. After
the command “halt” has been given, 1-1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> minutes are required to get
the gun ready for firing. The company carries 5940 rounds of ammunition

<p>The three machine gun companies assigned to the line of fortifications
consist of two to three platoons, each of four guns. A platoon consists
of 2 officers and 60 non-commissioned officers and privates. The men are
armed with rifles and equipped with alpine sticks. “Gun carriers” (<i>Waffenwarte</i>)
carry the gun basket, which weighs 33 kg. The weight of
the water in the jacket is only 1 kg. “Ammunition carriers” (<i>Munitionswarte</i>)
carry the ammunition in specially constructed frames, each man

<p>Kinds of fire: “<i>Fire by a single gun</i>” is employed at the opening of
an action to drive away patrols and reconnoitering officers, when it is not
desired to betray the presence of machine guns to the enemy.</p>

<p>“<i>Volley fire</i>” is the usual fire employed by machine guns and corresponds
to the volley fire of infantry. After the target and the elevation
have been designated, the platoon commander directs that fire he opened
by calling the name of the gun pointer who is to fire. A pause is made
after every series of 20-30 shots, which is used to make necessary corrections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page288">[288]</span></p>

<p>As soon as the proper elevation has been determined, “<i>rapid fire</i>” is
opened. In this the <i>guns of a platoon fire alternately</i>. The fire is delivered
in series of 100 rounds, and the time during which one of the guns is not
firing is utilized by the non-commissioned officer with it to examine and
oil the mechanism.</p>

<p>The “<i>fire at will</i>” (continuous fire) of the machine guns corresponds
to the magazine fire of the infantry. <i>All the guns fire simultaneously</i> series
of 50 to 100 rounds, interrupting the fire for a moment at the end of each
series for the purpose of examining and oiling the mechanism; then they
resume the fire with a new series of 50 to 100 rounds. On account of the
great expenditure of ammunition entailed, and also in order to prevent
the premature deterioration of the matériel, fire at will is used in exceptional
cases only, for example, when danger is imminent, or when favorable
opportunities offer.</p>

<p>“<i>Progressive fire</i>” may be employed against narrow, deep targets, when
the range could not be accurately determined. It may also be employed for
searching an area 100-200 m. deep.</p>

<p><b>Austria</b> has begun to organize <i>cavalry and mountain machine gun batteries</i>
consisting of four guns each. The machine gun Model 7 (<i>Schwarzlose</i>),
with pack animal equipment, has been adopted. The gun horse
carries 500, and each of the two ammunition horses, 1500 rounds of ammunition.
During mobilization two ammunition horses are to be added for
each gun. Mountain machine gun batteries are similarly organized; each
ammunition horse carries 2000 rounds of ammunition. On the gun itself,
and on the gun frame, 44 belts, each holding 250 rounds, or a total of

<p>Tripod mounts and pack animal transportation are necessary in view<span class="pagenum" id="Page289">[289]</span>
of Austrian theaters of war. The batteries consist of four machine guns.</p>

<p>“The great length of modern battle fronts, and the gaps and local
combats along the latter, would seem to make a distribution of machine
guns along the entire front desirable. Attention is thereby directed to
organizing the machine guns to be employed with the infantry as ‘Regimental
Machine Guns.’ Such an organization would best ensure the training
of this new arm for the infantry combat and the prompt attainment of
an understanding of its employment.</p>

<p>“In the cavalry, the difficulties of organizing, training, and employing
machine guns are considerably greater than in the infantry. These difficulties
are best overcome by organizing the machine guns assigned to
cavalry into independent batteries, and placing them at the disposal of the
higher cavalry commanders.</p>

<p>“In determining upon the size of the machine gun batteries attached
to infantry, an attempt should be made to combine minimum size with
adequate fire effect and maximum mobility. Two machine guns would
seem to be almost the maximum number that should be posted at one
point in an infantry action. From a tactical point of view, it is, moreover,
undesirable to post a greater number at one point, because gun shields,
steam, etc. would frequently form too prominent a target, for the hostile
artillery to forego firing on it promptly and with telling effect.</p>

<p>“In connection with the desire for more than two machine guns in
each infantry and Jäger organization&mdash;about two guns per battalion&mdash;the
tremendous increase in ammunition trains should be considered. It would
also be well to bear in mind that we have, as a matter of fact, not even
become accustomed to the numerous ammunition columns of our rapid fire
artillery.</p>

<p>“In the cavalry, the necessity of dividing a machine gun battery for the
purpose of assigning the parts thereof to brigades, and of assigning machine
guns to reconnaissance and other independent detachments, must be reckoned
with. When we bear in mind that single machine guns are to be used
only in exceptional cases, the machine gun battery intended for the cavalry
cannot well be made smaller than four guns.”<a id="FNanchor295" href="#Footnote295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

<p><b>England.</b> During the <b>Boer war</b> 1-2 machine guns mounted on a
high carriage were assigned to each of the British battalions. These guns
were unsuited to employment in an infantry combat and were quickly
silenced. The campaign demonstrated that these guns could frequently
not be used, and that they stood idle in rear of the line. They were
not combined into detachments for the purpose of supporting the attack,
as should have been done, until the engagement at <b>Pieters Hill</b> (27th Febr.,
1900). On account of the long range at which these guns came into
action, the effect of their fire was indeed very small, but, nevertheless, its
moral effect impaired the steadiness of the Boer aim. Since the great
fire power of these guns can be brought into play only when several of<span class="pagenum" id="Page290">[290]</span>
them are employed together, it is not a good plan to assign single guns
to cavalry regiments for the purpose of supporting the dismounted line in
action. Only the commander of the entire force, and not each battalion
commander, is able to judge where the employment of machine guns would
be advantageous. The proposal to assign machine guns to the artillery was
not followed, as it was justly feared that the machine guns would then
be assigned tasks to which they were not adapted.</p>

<p>At the present time, each battalion has a machine gun platoon consisting
of two guns. Both guns with their tripods, and a portion of the
ammunition, are transported on one wagon drawn by two horses. They
are in addition equipped with a two-horse ammunition cart. The complement
consists of 1 non-commissioned officer, 15 privates, 1 saddle horse,
and 4 draft horses.</p>

<p>Each battalion of mounted infantry has a machine gun platoon which
is similarly organized. Each of the four vehicles of this platoon is, however,
drawn by four horses. In addition, this platoon is equipped with six
machine gun pack saddles for transporting the guns on pack animals.
The complement consists of 1 officer, 1 first sergeant, 23 privates, 16
saddle horses, and 16 draft animals.</p>

<p>The machine gun platoon of a cavalry regiment consists of only one
gun, which is carried on a four-horse wagon, and a four-horse ammunition
wagon. The platoon is equipped with three pack saddles. The complement
consists of 1 officer, 1 non-commissioned officer, 13 privates, 11

<p><b>Japan</b> and <b>France</b> seem to have decided to follow the British in assigning
machine gun platoons to regiments. In <b>Japan</b>, soon after the
outbreak of the <b>Russo-Japanese war</b>, the Guard, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th
and 6th Divisions, and the two independent cavalry brigades, had machine
gun batteries consisting of 6 guns each. During the winter 1904-5, 320
machine guns were gradually placed in position, singly and by platoons,
in the fortifications on the Shaho.</p>

<p><b>Russia.</b> At the outbreak of the <b>Russo-Japanese war</b>, a machine gun
company was assigned to the 1st, 3rd and 5th East Siberian Rifle Brigades.<span class="pagenum" id="Page291">[291]</span>
This company consisted of 5 officers, 85 combatants, 13 non-combatants, 10
saddle horses, 29 draft horses, and eight guns. The latter were mounted
on high carriages, and were protected by steel shields. Of the ammunition,
1350 rounds, in belts holding 450 rounds each, were carried on each
gun carriage, and 4500 rounds on each of the six two-wheeled ammunition
carts. The field train consisted of nine one-horse carts. The loss of
the machine gun company at the <b>Yalu</b> was probably due to the fact that the
guns, mounted on high carriages, were quickly deprived of their mobility in
their second position, after they had, from their first position, effectively
flanked the advance of the Japanese infantry. Immediately after this
first lesson, the high wheeled carriage was apparently abolished, and the
tripod adopted. On September 26th, 1904, the machine gun companies
were reorganized. There were (old) wheeled, and (newly-organized) so-called
“mountain machine gun companies,” the latter having pack animal
transportation. These companies were assigned to infantry and Rifle
divisions and were designated by the numbers of their divisions.</p>

<p>On December 12th, 1906, the machine gun organization was again
changed, because it was asserted that the assignment of machine gun
companies to divisions hampered the division commander; that the employment
of 8 guns at one point was injudicious; and that so large a machine
gun battery actually induced a scattering of the guns. Infantry,
Reserve, and Rifle regiments are each assigned a machine gun organization
consisting of 4 guns, mounted on tripods, equipped with 6 mm. steel shields,
with pack animal transportation.</p>

<p>Complement: 3 officers, 7 non-commissioned officers, 46 privates, 7
non-combatants, 10 saddle horses, 21 pack and draft horses (8 of these for
carrying ammunition), 4 ammunition carts, and 5 train wagons. The personnel
is drawn from a regiment in which the men to be detailed for
machine gun duty are trained.</p>

<p>According to an officer who commanded a machine gun company in
the battle of <b>Liao Yang</b><a id="FNanchor296" href="#Footnote296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>, his company went into position on August
30th, on the right flank of its division behind an earth embankment at the
south edge of the village of Gutsealing, and 300 m. from the railroad running
in a southwesterly direction. This position was taken up with the
object of preventing the envelopment of the right flank of the division.
Sufficient time was available for cutting down the kaoliang crop for 650 m.
Beyond this range the kaoliang fields continued for several hundred
meters. Directly in front of the position of the company there was a
hill, upon which several mounted men showed themselves toward 10 A. M.
As soon as fire was opened on them, they threw themselves down in a field
covered with tall kaoliang. When these mounted men had reached a fairly
open space, about 900 m. from the machine gun company, they could be
clearly seen. In rear of them was observed a mountain battery of artillery,
which endeavored to go into position on the hill mentioned, apparently with
a view of directing a flanking fire on the Russian skirmishers farther to<span class="pagenum" id="Page292">[292]</span>
the front than the machine guns. Fire was opened at once, without first
bracketing the target, the first gun firing at 1200 paces (about 850 m.), and
each succeeding gun increasing the range by 25 paces, thus covering with
fire a space 150 m. deep. Immediately after fire was opened on it, the
mountain battery attempted to escape to the right, but succumbed to the
fire of the machine guns. The latter had fired about 1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> minutes, and had
expended 6000 rounds of ammunition. About noon, hostile (Japanese)
skirmishers attempted to cross the railroad embankment, one by one,
apparently with a view of flanking the machine guns. The latter opened
fire on the Japanese, combined sights, and, for a short period, rapid fire
with sweeping being resorted to. The movement made by the Japanese
was discontinued; an advance made by groups against the front of the
machine guns got only as far as the edge of the cleared kaoliang field. In
the open, the skirmishers were unable to advance a single step; every
attempt, on their part, to rise, was prevented. Whether it would have
been possible to advance by crawling, while keeping up a constant fire,
can, of course, not be determined now.</p>

<p>At nightfall the Japanese again advanced in the kaoliang field and
annoyed the machine gun company throughout the night with rifle fire.
At daybreak they were again driven back by a continued fire from the
machine guns. The Japanese skirmishers remained in readiness, however,
in the kaoliang field, and fired on any target that offered. When their
fire became more and more galling, the machine gun commander decided
to send forward a non-commissioned officer and 15 men (Reservists and
horse holders, armed with rifle and bayonet) to drive them out. The undertaking
was successful. It was found that this continuous annoying fire
had been kept up by only 1 officer and 24 men.</p>

<p>At 3 P. M., several Japanese assembled at the railway bridge; a signal
detachment also appeared. The fire at will of the infantry, directed on
this body of men, had no effect whatever; but after two machine guns, one
using an elevation of 1025, the other one of 1075 m., had fired on that point
for a short time, the Japanese disappeared. At 5 P. M., the machine guns
succeeded in repulsing an enveloping movement made against their right
flank. This movement was betrayed only by the motion of the kaoliang
stalks. Toward 7 P. M., the Japanese directed artillery fire upon the
machine guns, which suffered considerable losses, although the personnel
was protected by an earth parapet and had ceased to work the guns.
This fire did not cease until nightfall, and, at 9 P. M., the position was
evacuated by order. An attack made by the Japanese during the night
found the machine guns gone. During the two days of the fight the company
had lost 30% of its personnel, and had fired 26,000 rounds of ammunition,
or only about 3200 rounds per gun during two days. The superiority
of the fire of these machine guns over that of the Japanese skirmish line
can perhaps only be explained by the small numbers of the latter.</p>

<p>In the defensive position on the <b>Shaho</b> and at <b>Mukden</b>, machine
guns were employed in favorable positions, behind sandbag parapets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
under splinter proof roofs. According to Lieutenant-Colonel <span class="smcap">Anisinow</span>,
good results were obtained against skirmishers up to 1050 m., against closed
bodies of infantry and against troops of cavalry (<i>Eskadrons</i>) up to 1400
m.; against batteries of artillery, halted in the open, staffs, and columns,
the fire was sufficiently effective up to 1960 m.</p>

<h4>8. THE EMPLOYMENT OF MACHINE GUN
BATTERIES.</h4>

<p>Machine guns will never be able to replace artillery at
long ranges; on the other hand, they will often find an opportunity
to support other arms with their fire at medium and
short ranges.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that machine guns do not always follow
the movements of the firing lines in action, that the commander
of a force is not always able to find a good position for
them; and the question raised whether the space taken up by
the machine guns and their ammunition wagons in a column
could not be more profitably filled by companies of infantry
or by a portion of an ammunition column of corresponding
length. To be sure, machine guns are a special arm; the justification
of their existence lies in the combination of constant
readiness for firing with highly developed mobility, so that,
held back under direct control of the commander of a force,
they give him the means wherewith to produce within a short
time a sudden effect, in the nature of a surprise. This is the
very purpose for which machine guns were created. They are
not intended for prolonged fire action, not for accompanying
an infantry skirmish line in an advance by rushes, and, least
of all, for fighting well covered firing lines. In addition,
the fact that machine guns make it possible to concentrate fire
quickly on any space, whereby the moral effect is considerably
increased, ought not to be underestimated. It would seem to
be advisable to employ machine guns in conjunction with infantry
when it is impossible to develop a powerful fire on account
of the conformation of the ground, but when such fire
is desirable for commanding approaches or defiles; further,<span class="pagenum" id="Page294">[294]</span>
when fire alone suffices for delaying the enemy (for example,
in rear guard actions). In this case the guns may either be
pushed far to the front, or may be used in defensive positions,
which can then be held by a few men during the pauses in the
fight.<a id="FNanchor297" href="#Footnote297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Although machine gun fire may perhaps be relatively
less accurate than that of a body of infantry, the value of
pouring a large mass of projectiles on the enemy within a brief

<p><a id="Footnote297" href="#FNanchor297" class="label">[297]</a> At the Austrian Musketry School it was found that it was not easy for
a body of troops to fire on targets illuminated by the shaft of a search light;
few men possessed the requisite eyesight to make this possible. It would no
doubt be practicable, however, to attach such men to the machine guns posted
in a defensive position. A considerable increase in fire effect could thus be
obtained.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote298" href="#FNanchor298" class="label">[298]</a> Platoon volleys, directed for one minute on figures advancing from 1200-1100
paces, resulted in 5, fire at will, in 1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>, and machine gun fire, in 3% hits.
The three kinds of fire, when directed against 30 prone skirmishers, resulted,
in one minute, in 13, 18, and 10% hits, respectively.</p>

<p>Whether machine guns are distributed by platoons, or are
employed as a unit under control of superior leaders, will depend
upon whether it is contemplated to employ them in a
purely defensive way for the purpose of reinforcing the several
weak points, or offensively in fire surprises or in covering the
flanks. The distribution by platoons has the undeniable disadvantage
that single guns will frequently not find an opportunity
to fire; that the difficulty of ammunition supply is
increased; and that the combined employment of the several
platoons will produce friction that cannot be easily avoided.
On the other hand, in machine gun batteries of three platoons
each, an employment by platoons is easy. Although a distribution
by platoons is permissible in a passive defense, the employment
of the guns by battery (company) against the flanks
of the attacker permits the mobility and fire power of the
arm to be utilized to better advantage. While a distribution
of machine guns by platoons&mdash;if we except colonial and mountain
warfare&mdash;is, indeed, cheaper, it generally leads to a useless
frittering away of fighting units.<a id="FNanchor299" href="#Footnote299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Ulrich</span> (retired), who participated in the fighting in Manchuria,
voices the same opinion in <cite>Jahrbücher</cite>, March number, p. 285:</p>

<p>“The opinion has been quite prevalent that the organization of strong machine
gun units is one of the most important requirements of modern battle.”</p>

<p>Machine guns will be able to bring all their powers into
play to the best advantage at the beginning of a rencontre,
when, from their position as far forward as possible in the
column, they are pushed to the front to occupy important points
and to compel the enemy to deploy his infantry. The commander
should, however, endeavor to withdraw the machine
guns from the fight as soon as his own infantry has deployed,
in order to avoid involving the guns in a protracted fire fight
necessitating an expenditure of a great amount of ammunition
and in which the accuracy of their fire would gradually
suffer.<a id="FNanchor300" href="#Footnote300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> The proper sphere of machine guns lies in their employment
as a separate arm, whether they are posted so as to
flank an enemy, or are kept at the disposal of the commander
as an ever ready reserve, which is pushed forward to keep the
point to be attacked under fire, to meet a counter-attack, or&mdash;and
to this use they are best adapted&mdash;to participate in the
pursuit. Their employment is also proper in rear guard actions,
since they are able to remain in position longer, for
example, than rear guard infantry, whose energies are
paralyzed by the thought of getting away from the enemy in
time. Machine guns are much more independent than infantry
on account of their ability to withdraw at an increased gait.
On account of their greater staying power and the greater intensity
of their fire, they increase the delay which the enemy
suffers, as well as the start gained by their own force; they
moreover enable their own force to get away from the enemy
and to escape pursuit.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote300" href="#FNanchor300" class="label">[300]</a> This applies particularly to machine guns which have air cooled barrels.

<p>In employing machine guns in defense, it must be borne
in mind that the guns are not adapted to carry on protracted
fire actions; and that the advantage of the mobility of machine
gun batteries cannot be properly utilized if they have been assigned,
from the outset, a definite section to defend. As a
rule, it will be advisable, in defense, to keep the machine guns<span class="pagenum" id="Page296">[296]</span>
at first with the reserve, and to employ them later, as necessity
requires, even by platoons, to reinforce the defensive line at
threatened points, or, by battery (company), to prevent an
envelopment, or to participate in offensive movements. This
does not preclude the employment of machine guns during the
preparatory stage of the engagement, for example, to command
important approaches. When a covered withdrawal of
the guns is assured, it will also be possible to post machine gun
batteries in such a manner in front of, or to a flank of the
main defensive position, that they can suddenly sweep with
their fire the ground on which the opponent will probably
place his artillery. Flanking machine gun fire can sometimes
be employed for sweeping dead angles.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Austrian machine gun regulations
correspond in the main to those of the German Army. In
Austria special stress is laid upon the use of machine guns
with cavalry, while in Germany they are in addition a mobile
reserve. Machine gun batteries accomplish the principal objects
which cavalry expects to attain by the assignment of infantry,<a id="FNanchor301" href="#Footnote301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
viz., relief from fighting on foot, great fire power,
and mobility. Even in reconnaissance duty, machine guns will
be employed to break down the resistance of the enemy in occupied
localities and to augment the resistance of their own
force in such places. During an advance, machine guns should
go into position at an early moment in order to cover as effectively
as possible the approach and the deployment for attack.
It is advisable to post the guns of a machine gun battery
together, so as not to have numerous lines of fire interfere
with the movements of the cavalry; this is especially
emphasized by the Austrian regulations. Machine gun batteries,
like horse batteries (artillery), remain with the cavalry
divisions during a battle.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote301" href="#FNanchor301" class="label">[301]</a> In regard to the employment of machine guns in the maneuvers of 1905,

<p>German machine guns are especially adapted for resisting
cavalry, while guns transported upon pack animals are entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page297">[297]</span>
helpless on the march and when going into position, and
require the support of the other arms. German machine guns,
whether on their wheeled carriages or on their sleds, are capable
of warding off cavalry. The fire of the guns should be
distributed over the entire front of the mounted attacking line.
Special attention should be paid to lines following the first attacking
line, to the flanks of the guns themselves, and to
covering the carriages when they are not with the guns. Machine
guns are able to advance on open ground without regard
to cavalry, so long as the latter is not supported by
artillery or infantry, or is not so superior in force that it can
attack simultaneously from several directions, or in several
lines.</p>

<p>In action against artillery it should be borne in mind
that artillery possesses an unquestioned superiority of fire at
the longer ranges; at ranges at which machine guns are able
to fire at all, they must seek to find protection under cover,
or by distributing the guns. Artillery is very susceptible to
flanking fire. When that arm is to be engaged, the machine
gun sleds should be brought as close as possible to the hostile
batteries. In this case it is, moreover, advisable to have large
intervals between the machine gun platoons. The great mobility
of the machine gun battery, when limbered, will sometimes
enable it to take up a position from which it can flank
the enemy. In distributing machine gun fire it would be well
always to assign the same task to two guns. It is not a good
plan to have all the machine guns sweep the entire front of
a firing battery (artillery).</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The opinions in regard to machine gun employment in field warfare&mdash;mountain
and fortress warfare are not considered here&mdash;differ considerably.
In <b>England</b> machine guns are attached to battalions, and Japan of late leans
toward this mode of employment. In <b>Switzerland</b> machine guns serve in
addition as a substitute for horse batteries, which their army lacks.</p>

<p>The <b>English</b> view is obviously affected by their experience in colonial
wars.</p>

<p>The following are given as the duties of machine guns <i>in attack</i>:</p>

<p>1. The machine gun is above all to be employed at long ranges. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page298">[298]</span>
open country it will seldom be possible for the gun to reach a position in
the first line, where, moreover, the gun would offer too good a target.
Covered terrain should be taken advantage of to get the gun close to the
enemy. The advance of infantry may be supported at long ranges by machine
gun fire (fire of position).</p>

<p>2. The delivery of volley fire against any point of the hostile position.</p>

<p>3. The warding off of counter-attacks or attacks made by cavalry.</p>

<p>4. The utilization of flanking positions.</p>

<p>5. The support of cavalry during delaying actions (ammunition being
in this case a substitute for men) although the fire effect against low targets
is very small.</p>

<p>6. The holding of captured positions.</p>

<p><i>In defense</i> the isolated employment of machine guns at a distance from
the organization is prohibited and their use against extended skirmish lines
cautioned against. Machine guns are well adapted for protecting flanks
and can be kept back as a reserve to prevent the advance of hostile reinforcements,
to support counter-attacks, to direct fire against deep and
dense targets, and, finally, to support the firing line in action at short
range.</p>

<p><i>In defense</i> the principal duties of machine guns will consist <span class="nowrap">of&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Sweeping obstacles and commanding terrain which is specially
favorable for the attack; flanking of salients.</p>

<p>2. Reinforcing weak points.</p>

<p>3. Firing on advancing hostile reinforcements.</p>

<p>The cavalry regulations, contrary to those of the infantry, also permit
a massed employment of machine guns when ordered by brigade or division
commanders.</p>

<p>“As a rule, it will not be advisable to open fire on isolated mounted
men or small groups of approximately platoon strength, as this would
betray the position prematurely. In action, machine guns may be employed
in conjunction with dismounted skirmishers for the purpose of
forming a supporting point for movements, a rallying position, or for protecting
a flank. Finally, during an attack, machine guns may support the
fire of the horse battery, on the outer flank of which they go into position,
to serve as support, or to facilitate by their fire a withdrawal.”</p>

<p>These official regulations are not entirely in accord with the views
entertained in the army. The combined use of the machine guns of a
brigade, such as quite naturally resulted in the engagement at <b>Pieters Hill</b>,
is advocated by many. At the longer ranges, machine gun companies are
to fire on favorable targets, discontinuing their fire when their object has
been accomplished. In addition they are to cover the advance or withdrawal
of the infantry; to fire on certain points of the hostile position; to act
against the enemy’s flanks in pursuit; and, in defense, posted in pairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page299">[299]</span>
they are to flank salient angles and make it difficult for the enemy to
approach the obstacles.</p>

<p>In <b>Switzerland</b> machine guns are considered an auxiliary arm. “Our
field army should be capable of accepting and sustaining battle in the
mountains and on highland plateaus without necessitating the creation of
numerous special detachments for that purpose. Machine gun companies
should be a tool which can be used in the mountains and on highland
plateaus, and which can be turned over for use to any organization.”</p>

<p>The platoon is the firing unit; the company commander posts his
platoons at large intervals and regulates their mutual coöperation. Fire,
suddenly delivered from various points, frequently rather far distant from
each other, is considered to have a particularly demoralizing effect; the
scattered posting of the platoons makes it difficult for the enemy to combat
effectively the individual platoons which are skillfully concealed on the
terrain. “The indefinable, uncanny and confusing aspect of their appearance
enhances the effect of the fire surprise.” The defensive character
is here especially clearly marked, for cavalry which counts in the first
place on the offensive will prefer a combined employment of machine
guns, so as not to be hampered in its movements by the various lines of
fire. On the march, machine guns are posted as far forward as possible
in the column; single platoons may also be attached to troops (<i>Eskadrons</i>)
of advance guard cavalry, and, in exceptional cases only, to troops
(<i>Eskadrons</i>) of reconnoitering cavalry. Machine guns, supported by weak
cavalry detachments, may be pushed forward to occupy defiles; moreover,
the machine gun company assigned to a cavalry brigade may be sent into
action either as a whole unit, or it may be divided from the start or during
the course of the fight. This machine gun company may also be attached to
regiments, troops (<i>Eskadrons</i>) or platoons of cavalry charged with special
missions, in which case it is, as a rule, broken up into platoons. The premature
detaching of machine gun units is especially cautioned against.
“The mobility of the machine gun unit is such that it is not at all dangerous
to hold them back until the last moment before sending them
to the actually threatened point.”</p>

<p>The regulations deem a special support necessary for the machine
gun batteries when they are sent on independent missions. Single guns
are not to be so used. Machine guns, distributed by platoons, invest cavalry
dismounted for fire action with a special power of resistance. It will
frequently be advantageous to occupy the enemy in front with weakly supported
machine gun batteries, while maneuvering with the main body of
the mounted force so as to gain the enemy’s weak point, and attacking him
there with fire or a charge. In a cavalry fight Maxim machine gun marksmen,
by timely, hold, and energetic action, will very often be able to create
favorable conditions for their own troops, facilitate the selection of a
point of attack, and retard and interfere with the hostile deployment.</p>

<p>The following statements taken from the regulations for the <cite>Service
and Training of <b class="nonitalic">Swiss</b> cavalry</cite> (1904) are of interest:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span></p>

<p>“Machine guns invest pursuing cavalry with tremendous power.&mdash;Their
violent fire, suddenly breaking forth, especially when quickly delivered
at the flanks of the retreating mass, must have an annihilating
effect and convert the retreat into a rout.</p>

<p>“In a retreat, Maxim gun marksmen with their guns can quickly
occupy rallying positions (when possible, flanking), which, thanks to their
mobility, they are capable of holding longer than other arms. Thereby
they facilitate for the other troops the critical breaking off of the engagement.</p>

<p>“The retreat will proceed with greater steadiness and time will be
gained for organizing resistance and for making that resistance more obstinate.</p>

<p>“When, during the crisis of battle, every available man joins in the
fight, machine guns may take a hand in it, even when the terrain is unfavorable
for the employment of cavalry, by gaining the flanks at a rapid
gait, turning and firing upon the hostile flank or the hostile masses launched
for the counter-attack.</p>

<p>“It would be incorrect, however, at such a moment, simply to throw
the machine guns into the fighting line or to a flank. By doing this the
mobility of the guns would not be utilized, and they would lose their character
of a mounted arm.</p>

<p>“The assignment of machine guns to cavalry augments the fighting
power and independence of the latter and increases to the utmost its desire
to go ahead, its enterprise and bold initiative. With the aid of machine
guns, our militia cavalry, even when opposed by better drilled cavalry, can
go into battle calmly on our terrain, with the firm conviction of defeating it.</p>

<p>“But a cavalry leader should never shrink from sacrificing his machine
guns when the object to be attained requires it, and when no other
means remain to save the force. <i>These weapons should never be more
to him than a welcome and powerful aid toward the fulfillment of his
mission. Cavalry which degenerates into a mere support for its machine
guns has ceased to be cavalry.</i>”</p>

<p>The individual infantryman whose rifle is loaded and who
knows how to use his bayonet is more than a match for the
individual mounted man even on open ground; and, if he remains
cool, retains his presence of mind, and uses his rifle
properly while keeping the opponent constantly in view, he is
even superior to several mounted men. Infantry which retains
its steadiness has nothing to fear even when outnumbered by
cavalry. Its main strength lies in steadily delivered fire, while
cavalry relies on the possibility of making an unexpected rapid
charge, on quickly covering great distances, and on the moral
effect which its irresistible onslaught undoubtedly produces
upon infantry. So long as there is a possibility of surprise and
misunderstanding, of infantry allowing itself to become discouraged,
and of the individual soldier being exposed to hunger
and hardships, so long will cavalry that is energetically led be
able to gain brilliant victories. Tactics would look differently
upon the possibility of making a mounted charge during a
battle if one or two German cavalry divisions had been on the
Japanese side during the pursuit after Mukden. “If we demand
of infantry that it close with the enemy after it has
suffered tremendous losses, why should we not demand the
same of cavalry whose mobility is disproportionately greater.”
(<cite>Skobeleff’s Order for the Day, June 15th, 1882</cite>). The less
the world believes in a victory of cavalry, the greater the certainty
of such success. The troops should be accustomed in
time of peace to the sight of charging cavalry. The recommendation<span class="pagenum" id="Page302">[302]</span>
made by the late General Dragomirov of the Russian
army is, at any rate, worthy of consideration.<a id="FNanchor303" href="#Footnote303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> He proposed
that cavalry ride at full speed through infantry lines deployed
with three paces between files. Some infantrymen are,
indeed, bound to be injured in such charges, but the wounds
produced are not likely to be serious. Infantry accustomed to
such charges will not lose its steadiness so easily in action as
when it comes in contact with cavalry for the first time on the
battlefield.</p>

<p>The success of the charge made by Captain Bechtoltsheim of the
Austrian army at <b>Custozza</b> with three platoons of Sicilian Uhlans, may
be ascribed principally to the fact that the Italian infantry was not accustomed
to field service and lacked training. This small force of cavalry
broke entirely through Pisa’s deployed Brigade (Italian) and struck the
route column of Forli’s Brigade, throwing it into complete panic, so that
of five battalions only one remained intact. The three platoons of cavalry,
which numbered about 100 sabers, lost 2 officers, 84 men, and 73
horses killed and wounded. The charge made by three troops (<i>Eskadrons</i>)
of the Dragoons of the Guard at <b>Mars-la-Tour</b>, to facilitate the retreat
of the defeated 38th Brigade, and that made by two platoons of the 7th
Hussars at <b>Sapignies</b> were likewise successful.</p>

<p>Any formation that permits effective firing is suitable for
warding off cavalry. Skirmish lines through which a cavalry
charge passes suffer losses that scarcely deserve mention. The
fight is not hopeless even when the hostile troopers halt within
the ranks of the infantry. When cavalry has charged through
a skirmish line, the latter should be careful not to face about
to fire at the troopers,<a id="FNanchor304" href="#Footnote304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> as that would give a second cavalry
line an opportunity to approach and strike it unawares.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote304" href="#FNanchor304" class="label">[304]</a> “The French firing lines through which the cavalry had charged (evening
attack made by Rauch’s Brigade in the direction of Rezonville on August 16th,
1870) fired after the Hussars, while the French Infantry units in rear fired in
the opposite direction. The result was a frightful cross-fire, which, while undoubtedly
disastrous for the Hussars, certainly must have worked havoc among
the French.” <span class="smcap">Kunz</span>, <cite>Reiterei</cite>, p. 153.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The supports in rear of the first line form the objective
of the cavalry after it has charged through the firing line.
These supports must therefore open fire on the cavalry regardless
of the skirmishers in front.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page303">[303]</span></p>

<p>The flanks of a firing line can be bent back only when
that line is not exposed to hostile infantry fire. The threatened
wing should never be bent forward since that interferes
with the fire of adjacent units. The task of repulsing an attack
directed against a flank had best be left to the supports in
rear of the flanks. The German Cavalry Drill Regulations
(par. 349) state, that toward the end of a fight the bulk of the
supports and reserves will have been absorbed by the firing
line; that the fire that such a line could direct toward a flank
would be insignificant; and that at any rate a <i>new</i> firing line
could not be formed within a short time; and, therefore, that
a charge against its flank would be advantageous. This statement
should be a warning for us always to retain echelons or
machine guns in rear of the flanks. The most critical situation
for infantry is that in which it is charged by cavalry while
retiring defeated under hostile fire with no supports available
to repulse the attack. A halt means annihilation; it must be
left to each individual to save himself as best he can.</p>

<p>During the battle of <b>Scheinovo</b>, three companies of the 11th Russian
Rifle Regiment made an unsuccessful attack and had to retreat under the
pursuing fire of the Turks, while Turkish cavalry began to charge their
left flank. When only 200-300 m. from the Turks, the 4th Company, which
was most seriously threatened, halted and formed square as if on the
parade ground. During this maneuver, all the officers and many non-commissioned
officers were either killed or wounded. The heavy losses of
the battalion (50%) may, in the main, be ascribed to this halt under the
most violent fire of the enemy.<a id="FNanchor305" href="#Footnote305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>When the cavalry charge comes more from the front,
however, the hostile infantry and artillery will have to stop
firing, and it may then be possible to rally or re-form the
defeated force, provided the men will heed their leaders.</p>

<p>Units in close order can deploy quickly toward the front
or flank for the purpose of firing. However, they will be able to
fire in close order only when not themselves subjected to hostile
fire. The front and flanks of a body of infantry in proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page304">[304]</span>
formation are equally strong, but, in this connection, it should
be borne in mind that a deployment toward a flank, for the
purpose of firing, always takes time and is apt to impair the
steadiness of the men.<a id="FNanchor306" href="#Footnote306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

General <span class="smcap">von Scherff</span> (<cite>Kriegslehren</cite>, II, p. 263) believes that a frontal
charge made by cavalry of sufficient strength has better chances of succeeding
than a charge in deep formation against a flank. In a frontal charge, the
suddenly appearing cavalry is exposed “only to the fire at will of individual
skirmishers whose continuous front masks the fire of units in rear.” In the
other case (charge against a flank) the cavalry receives not only the fire of the
closed bodies first encountered, but also that of the supports firing through the
gaps between these groups. The frontal attacks executed with superb gallantry
by the French cavalry at Sedan rather prove the opposite.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>If time admits, a position may be looked for near obstacles,
such as ditches, hedges, swampy ground, etc., which impede the
hostile cavalry. It is not necessary, however, for the infantry
to occupy the obstacle itself; in fact, it is better to take up
a position some distance away. The shortness of our rifles
obliges us to form the firing unit at right angles to the line
of advance of the approaching cavalry, and to avoid aiming
obliquely. The provision contained in a number of drill regulations,
including the French, that the bodies in close order
(supports, reserves) should be formed in echelon, is objectionable,
as this is apt to lead to their firing on one another (as
the French infantry did in repulsing the charge made by
Bredow’s Brigade and the Dragoons of the Guard at Vionville).
The deployment from “broad” and “deep” column to
meet a sudden cavalry charge can, as a rule, be ordered directly
by company commanders on the caution of the battalion commander,
the method of meeting the attack being promptly decided
upon. The main thing is to be in instant readiness for
firing and to protect the flanks by means of echelons.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In a deployment from “deep column,” the measures taken by the commanders
of the rear companies must conform to those of the leading
companies. To meet a cavalry charge coming from the right front, for
example, the following scheme would be appropriate:</p>

<p><i>The 1st Company</i> forms left front into line so that its front is at
right angles to the line of advance of the cavalry;</p>

<p><i>The 2nd Company</i> forms as a support in rear of the left flank of the
first company;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span></p>

<p><i>The 3rd Company</i> forms right front into line, and prolongs the line
of the first company;</p>

<p><i>The 4th Company</i> also forms right front into line, or is held in readiness
as a support in rear of the right flank. In this way the approaching
cavalry can be met by the fire of from six to eight platoons.</p>

<p>It is a very simple matter to ward off a cavalry charge
directed against the flank of a marching column (form line by
wheeling by squads). When the cavalry charge is directed
against the head or the tail of a column, as recommended by the
German Cavalry Drill Regulations (par. 350), there will not
be time enough, as a rule, for the entire company or battalion
to form line. It will suffice to let the leading elements form
line, the rear elements moving out of the column and forming
in rear of the flanks as supports.</p>

<p>Successful resistance does not depend upon the formation
taken up; in fact the latter is of importance only when it increases
the feeling of security. The morale of an organization
is of more importance than the formation taken up. A proud
confidence in victory and morale are the only factors which
decide success, and the training of infantry should be such as
to develop these qualities.</p>

<p>Cavalry will in many cases consider that it has gained a
success if it causes infantry to discontinue a movement, or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page306">[306]</span>
take up formations which interfere with the highest development
of its fire, or which offer favorable targets to the hostile
infantry and artillery. This is especially the case where infantry
is in the act of beginning an assault, when the slightest
hesitation may jeopardize success. If cavalry actually begins to
charge at this moment, only the bodies immediately threatened
halt at the signal “attention,”<a id="FNanchor307" href="#Footnote307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and face the cavalry; the
remainder continue the march.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote307" href="#FNanchor307" class="label">[307]</a> The German army is the only one that employs an appropriate signal for
this purpose. The attack made by the 28th Infantry Brigade against the wood
of Bor at Königgrätz is very instructive in this connection. <span class="smcap">Hönig</span>, <cite>Taktik der
Zukunft</cite>, p. 56. At the signal, “cavalry,” the threatened portions of the brigade
halted and formed square. Fortunately the Saxons had already begun to retire
from the edge of the wood. A stray hostile troop (<i>Eskadron</i>) had caused all the
trouble.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The sudden appearance of a line of charging cavalry produces
such a tremendous psychological effect on troops not immediately
threatened, that they either watch the attack passively,
or else too many of them take a hand in repulsing it.
This moment, in which the attention of the troops is so completely
riveted on the cavalry, is seldom utilized for the purpose
of gaining ground to the front, or for effecting a withdrawal.<a id="FNanchor308" href="#Footnote308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
It needs but little imagination to picture to one’s
self the success which the French army could have gained at
Waterloo if infantry masses had followed on the heels of Ney’s
cavalry squadrons. In the battle of Vionville the German
infantry fired at the most incredible angles at the charging
French Guard cavalry. While Bredow’s Brigade was making
its charge during the same battle, part of the infantry of the
6th Division stopped firing on the French skirmishers, to follow
with intense interest the cavalry charge that was taking place
on a totally different part of the battlefield. This conduct, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span>
natural as incorrect, suggests the advisability of profiting by
such moments of the enemy’s inattention for the purpose of
executing a movement or holding him with our own fire. It
also seems absolutely necessary to support with rifle fire the
charge made by one’s own cavalry, or at any rate to prevent the
hostile infantry from firing undisturbed on our troopers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote308" href="#FNanchor308" class="label">[308]</a> “Every leader should carefully watch the progress of a cavalry charge, and,
as soon as he observes that friendly cavalry has succeeded in penetrating the
hostile line or that the enemy is shaken and directs all of his fire against the
charging cavalry, he should immediately advance to the attack and be upon the
enemy with the bayonet before the latter recovers his senses. Such an attack will
not have been made in vain, even if the cavalry has been repulsed.” General
<span class="smcap">Gurko’s</span> comments on the maneuvers of 1893.</p>

<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Frederick Charles</span>, in his <cite>Winke für die Offiziere der unter Meinen
Befehlen ins Feld rückenden Truppen</cite> (1870), also demands that the infantry
should quickly follow up cavalry attacks.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>There are other reasons, however, why a sharp lookout
should be kept during a hostile cavalry charge. All cavalry
drill regulations recognize that a charge has greater chances
of succeeding when it is made in deep formation, in successive
lines, or simultaneously from several directions. The fire of the
infantry is distributed, and, unless a good lookout is kept, a
part of the cavalry, scarcely or not at all molested by fire, may
perhaps succeed in driving the attack home. This will be the
case when infantry allows itself to be enticed into developing
a heavy fire in a direction from which only a feint is made,
while the main attack comes from another, or from several
other directions. Well led infantry will, therefore, never employ
more rifles in repulsing cavalry than are absolutely necessary,
while the mere threat of a cavalry charge will induce badly
led infantry to develop an excessive volume of fire.</p>

<p>On open terrain, when the approaching cavalry is visible at
a considerable distance, and when the infantry itself is exposed
to effective fire, the prone aiming position is to be preferred.
The men lying flat on the ground are not so easily wounded by
the hostile troopers, and the horses will generally avoid stepping
on them, besides which, the danger space is greater than when
the men fire standing. In rolling or close country, where cavalry
cannot be seen by men lying down, the aiming position
kneeling or standing should properly be assumed. The losses
inflicted by hostile fire must then be endured. Horses and
riders are more apt to lose dash when charging an upright
human wall that is spouting fire, than when charging a kneeling
or prone opponent who scarcely offers an obstacle to the
charge. What is of greater importance, however, is that men<span class="pagenum" id="Page308">[308]</span>
standing upright can more easily execute a change of front,
fire on passing cavalry, and use their bayonets in case the
cavalry actually penetrates their line. The British and Italian
regulations very properly prescribe that the front rank of a
body of infantry in close order should kneel in such cases.</p>

<p>As the success of infantry depends to a great extent upon
the steadiness with which it receives the cavalry, it would
seem to be advantageous to withhold the fire until the cavalry
gets within short range.<a id="FNanchor309" href="#Footnote309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> General Dragomirov says in his
forcible manner, “It is not the bullet which has been fired, but
the bullet which is still in the rifle-barrel, and reserved for
short range, that harms charging cavalry.” If infantry in
line was able to repulse a cavalry charge in the past at 40
paces, with smoothbore muskets and at the first volley,<a id="FNanchor310" href="#Footnote310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> the
chances of doing this with modern rifles would be still greater,
if the “stopping power” of the 8 mm. projectiles were absolutely
certain at short ranges. As this is not the case, it is
necessary to open fire at an earlier moment.<a id="FNanchor311" href="#Footnote311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
If infantry does<span class="pagenum" id="Page309">[309]</span>
not fire until cavalry gets within very short range, it will have
to reckon with the fact that even wounded horses will still be
able to carry their riders into its ranks. However, for purposes
of instruction in time of peace, it is proper to open fire late. If
an infantry unit is trained in time of peace always to open
fire at the medium ranges on charging cavalry, the unexpected
appearance of hostile cavalry at short ranges in actual war,
is more likely to bring disorder into the ranks of such a unit,
than if it is trained in time of peace to reserve its fire until the
cavalry has come within short range.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote309" href="#FNanchor309" class="label">[309]</a> “The best preparation against rapidly executed mounted charges is for all
commanders to keep their eyes open, quickly and coolly to size up the situation,
and to act with determination. All precipitation or haste would be disastrous,
for it would communicate itself to the troops. Infantry has never yet fired
too late upon cavalry.” Feldzeugmeister <span class="smcap">v. Wäldstatten</span>.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote310" href="#FNanchor310" class="label">[310]</a> At Sedan, the 5th Company of the 46th Infantry fired only at 140 and 80
paces, and repulsed the charge. <cite>Geschichte des Regiments Nr. 46</cite>, p. 186. In
the same battle the 9th and 12th Companies of the 87th Infantry repulsed a
charge at 60 paces. <cite>Gen. St. W.</cite>, II, p. 1217.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote311" href="#FNanchor311" class="label">[311]</a> The <cite>France Militaire</cite> contains the following statement in regard to the
effect produced on horses by bullets from the French Lebel rifle in the engagements
near Casablanca in 1907: “Many officers serving in the field observed that
the small caliber bullets stopped horses only when a foot had been shattered or
when a vital organ had been hit. <i>At Casablanca, horses that had been hit by
several bullets continued to gallop for a long while.</i> This is a remarkable
phenomenon, for the gentlemen of theory count as out of action every horse
that has been hit by a projectile. This is entirely incorrect. <i>Many wounded
horses carry their riders into the melée and do not die until the day after the
fight.</i> This was observed on the French as well as on the Moroccan side.</p>

<p>“Troopers charging full tilt, with the firm determination of penetrating the
hostile line, are not stopped so easily. In the first place, they would have to be
hit, and that, in itself, is not such an easy matter. This is still more difficult
for the infantry, if it knows the dash of the hostile troopers. Let us cultivate
the dash of our cavalrymen, even if unreal situations are thereby produced in
our peace exercises. If, on the other hand, we teach our troopers in time of
peace to turn tail in the face of imaginary projectiles, we are training our
cavalry for panic in time of war.”</p>

<p>At <b>Garcia Hernandez</b> (1812), a French square was broken by a
wounded horse falling down within the ranks of the infantry. This is,
however, only true of closed bodies of infantry formed in two ranks.
Horses will frequently break through a skirmish line&mdash;whether or not the
horses are wounded is immaterial. Men are wounded in such an event in
exceptional cases only, and the wounds produced are generally insignificant.</p>

<p>The following episode shows the effect produced on cavalry when it
attacks unshaken infantry which is in good formation and reserves its
fire. During the retreat after the battle of <b>Jena</b>, on October 28th, 1806, the
Grenadier Battalion <i>Prinz August</i>, threatened by hostile cavalry, did not
feel equal to continue its march to Prenzlau and attempted to cross the
Ucker farther down. In the expectation that a cavalry charge would be
made, square was formed and the officers were told not to fire until the
cavalry had approached to within 20 paces. “Meantime, the French cavalry&mdash;the
brigade which had crossed at Golmitz as well as the remainder
of Beaumont’s Division, under its commander, in all nine regiments&mdash;approached.
The first charge was made by nine troops (<i>Eskadrons</i>) under
the division commander. They approached at a gallop. When the expected
fire did not come, the dragoons gradually reined in their horses, so that
finally they were going no faster than a slow trot. At 30 paces the
command “Fire” was given in the infantry and quite a number of troopers
fell, the rest galloping by the square on both sides. Eight subsequent
charges were repulsed in a similar manner.”<a id="FNanchor312" href="#Footnote312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>We have moreover to consider, in this connection, the
strength of the infantry, the formation of the cavalry, and
whether the latter charges from several directions or in several<span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span>
successive lines. A small force of infantry, especially when
it may anticipate attacks from several directions, must open fire
sooner than a strong infantry force which has to contend with
an attack coming from one direction only. In the first mentioned
case, an attempt must be made to meet quickly, one by
one, the attacks which follow each other at intervals.</p>

<p>It is quite a different matter when the infantry itself is not
directly threatened, but can take a hand in repulsing a cavalry
charge made on another unit; then it is advisable to open fire
at an early moment in order to break the momentum of the
charge at long range. (11th Jäger-Battalion at Wörth; 8th
Company of the 46th Infantry at Sedan).</p>

<p>This in part determines the rear sight elevation that should
be used. The sights should not be changed on the battlefield,
although this has been done on the drill ground by well trained
soldiers without impairing the continuity or accuracy of the
fire. According to the table of ordinates of the trajectory
(par. 23 German I. F. R.), a bullet fired when the sight is
set at 700 m. and aim is taken at the feet of the horse, does
not rise above the height of a mounted trooper throughout
that entire distance. The bullets may pass entirely over the target
however, when the men take too full a sight in the excitement
of battle, or when, in rolling country or terrain
covered with grass or crops, they cannot see the bottom of the
target and aim above that line. It is better, therefore, to aim
at the breast of the horse, with sights set at 600 m., and to
fire as soon as the target gets within 800 m. On account of
the excitement attending every cavalry charge, it is not advisable
to change sights.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to fire one volley first and then to employ
fire at will. It is not easy for infantry, while awaiting
the onrushing mass of cavalry, to reserve its fire until, in the
opinion of the leader, the first shot may be fired. But this
waiting is of great importance to prevent the fire from becoming
wild and ineffective. Since the elimination of powder<span class="pagenum" id="Page311">[311]</span>
smoke, there is no reason why other volleys should be fired
after the first, for in the excitement of the fight the volley
cannot produce a moral effect. The horses certainly find the
rattling of fire at will more unpleasant than the sudden crack
of a volley. The advantage of the volley, of permitting a
unit to be kept better in hand, may be an important factor
under certain circumstances however. The volley should, as a
rule, be used by supports that are not exposed to fire. (8th Company
of the 32nd Infantry at Wörth; the 1st and 2nd Companies
of the 83rd Infantry, and the 5th Company of Jägers
at Sedan).</p>

<p>Since the principal object of the fire is to destroy the cohesion
of the charge, and as cavalry always closes toward the
center while charging, no special importance need be attached
to the distribution of the fire.</p>

<p>As regards relative numerical strength, a platoon of infantry
consisting of 60 rifles (firing 360-500 rounds per
minute), should be a match for 1-3 troops (<i>Eskadrons</i>), and
a company of infantry, under favorable conditions, may be able
to deal with a cavalry brigade.<a id="FNanchor313" href="#Footnote313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Cavalry can become dangerous
for infantry only when the infantry is surprised, finds no
opportunity to fire, loses its steadiness and morale, or attempts
to reach cover by running.</p>

<h4>The Charge of the French Cuirassiers of the Guard at
Vionville.</h4>

<div class="longquote">

<p>At half past 12 on the afternoon of August 16th, 1870, the companies
of the 10th Prussian Infantry Brigade were advancing east of Flavigny
towards the Metz&mdash;Mars-la-Tour <i>chaussee</i>. As French infantry was not on
the spot to put a stop to this movement, the 3rd Lancers and the Guard
Cuirassier Regiment received orders to attack. The former regiment went
to the rear, as no definite objective (?) had been assigned to it.</p>

<p>The Guard Cuirassier Regiment was formed in two lines, 150 m. distance
between them, with two troops (<i>Eskadrons</i>) in each line, a fifth troop<span class="pagenum" id="Page312">[312]</span>
(<i>Eskadron</i>) following as a reserve. Although hampered in its movements
and thrown into disorder by abandoned baggage wagons and other camp
litter that covered the ground, the regiment nevertheless made the charge
with superb gallantry.</p>

<p>The charge struck the 6th and 7th Companies of the 52nd Infantry,
under Captain Hildebrand. These companies, rifles in hand and their
leader in front, awaited the French cavalry, which came into view at a
distance of 1200 m. The first echelon (6th and 4th Troops) was received
with rapid fire at 250 paces. On the right, the 6th Troop
(<i>Eskadron</i>) approached to within 60-80 paces of the Prussians, but a
part then turned to the rear while a few troopers turned to the left. It is
said, that of the leaders only one officer and one non-commissioned officer
remained in the saddle, and that only twenty cuirassiers were rallied after
the charge. The left troop (<i>Eskadron</i>) missed its objective completely.
The Prussian rear rank faced about and fired on some French troopers
who attempted to make an attack from the rear and who now also received
fire from other units of Prussian infantry.</p>

<p>During the charge, the distance between the first and second lines had
become greater than at first ordered. When the first line broke in two,
the second was still some 300 m. distant from the Prussian infantry and
suffered some losses, probably from stray shots, which did not stop the
movement however, as the fire soon ceased. German accounts, to be
sure, do not mention that the second line could not be seen on account of
the powder smoke, and that the fire was discontinued to let the smoke
clear away. When the French line was 100 m. away it received the command
<i>chargez</i> and the Prussian infantry again resumed its rapid fire, which
shattered the attack, the leading troopers breaking down in a ditch about
10 paces in front of the Prussian line. The third line, its cohesion impaired
and its advance hampered by fallen horses and riders, was just
as little able to reach the Prussian companies. The right wing of the
Cuirassiers raced around the left flank of the companies of the 52nd Infantry
and encountered the Füsilier Battalion of the 12th Infantry, deployed
in a single firing line, dense in the center. Some parts of this
battalion formed squares. The charge was definitely stopped by the fire of
this battalion. An attempt to rally the Cuirassiers was prevented by
Prussian cavalry which now moved out. The French regiment, which had
begun its attack with 575 sabers, had lost 22 officers, 208 men (36.2% of
its strength), and 243 horses. According to Dick de Lonlay,<a id="FNanchor314" href="#Footnote314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> after this
charge, the regiment was able to form only 4 troops (<i>Eskadrons</i>) of 62
troopers each, instead of 5 troops (<i>Eskadrons</i>) of 115 troopers each,
which would mean a loss of 248 men. The first line had suffered the
heaviest losses; in the 4th troop (<i>Eskadron</i>), which had lost all of its
officers and non-commissioned officers, only 18 men were left.</p>

<p>During the attack made by two troops (<i>Eskadrons</i>) of Landwehr
Hussars against the 1st Battalion <i>Gyulai</i> at <b>Tobitschau</b>, an Austrian

attack of Bredow’s Brigade at <b>Vionville</b>, the artillery was able to send its
last shells against the enemy immediately past the right flank of the
cavalry brigade.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The employment of cavalry in masses, contemplated in
all armies, compels us to consider the case when infantry must
advance over open ground in the face of hostile cavalry. Special
units must then be designated, who, by means of long range
fire, repulse the cavalry or keep it at a distance. At Minden
(1759), Anglo-Hanoverian infantry succeeded in driving the
hostile cavalry from the field, and at Vauxchamps and Etoges
(14th February, 1814), Prussian infantry succeeded in breaking
through the French cavalry. It will be easy to do the
same thing with modern weapons, so long as cavalry is not
very superior in numbers, and is not supported by infantry,
machine guns, or artillery.</p>

<p>Infantry attacking dismounted cavalry should endeavor to
bring long range fire to bear on the led horses or threaten them
by a flank attack. For infantry to prolong the action at long
and medium ranges is only playing into the hands of the cavalry,
and besides, the better marksmanship of the infantry is
bound to make itself felt at short ranges. When the infantry
has once gotten to within 700 paces (560 m.) of the dismounted
cavalry, it is very doubtful whether the latter will still be able
to mount; at the very least, it will be difficult for it to do so
(par. 362 German C. D. R.), even though the withdrawal can
be effected under cover, or when fresh troops take a hand in
the fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span></p>

<h4>Provisions of Various Regulations.</h4>

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>England.</b> The possibility of a successful cavalry charge is almost
universally contested. When necessary, the skirmishers that are immediately
threatened close in toward the center. Bayonets are to be fixed.
An opportunity for successful employment of cavalry is offered when infantry
has fired away all of its ammunition; when it is forced to retire;
and when the approach of the cavalry is facilitated by dust, fog, or heavy
rain.</p>

<p><b>Austria.</b> <i>Brave and steady infantry has nothing to fear from cavalry
charges, so long as it retains its steadiness, presence of mind, and morale,
and delivers its fire steadily and with good aim at short range.</i></p>

<p>When fighting cavalry, movements and changes of formation should
be ordered only when sufficient time is available, and then only for the
purpose of bringing a sufficient number of rifles into action and for better
utilizing the terrain. When a cavalry charge is suddenly made from a
short distance, it is better to remain in a narrow formation than to deploy
hastily, provided the fire is delivered with steadiness. As cavalry frequently
attacks only for the purpose of forcing the infantry to discontinue
its advance, or to induce it to take up a close order formation, all units
not immediately threatened by the attack should continue their movement
or remain in their positions.</p>

<p>When a force has to cover long stretches under conditions which
make it probable that a cavalry attack will be made, the battalions, companies,
or platoons should be so grouped that they can quickly meet the
cavalry attack in any direction, and can mutually support each other in
warding it off. Staffs and vehicles should place themselves within the protected
area thus formed.</p>

<p>The threatened units turn in the appropriate direction, properly utilizing
cover and obstacles while so doing, and, when necessary, fix bayonets.
Only such a part of the force is designated to fire as seems necessary for
warding off the attack; the other parts continue to carry out the task assigned
them. The commander retains a part of his force in readiness for
warding off unexpected attacks.</p>

<p>“When exposed to hostile fire while warding off a cavalry charge,
the men should assume the position offering the smallest target.</p>

<p>“If a platoon is <i>directly attacked</i> by cavalry, it will only in rare cases
be advisable to open fire at ranges beyond 600 paces (450 m.); <i>frequently
it will be a good plan, however, to let the cavalry come up close</i>. When the
platoon participates in warding off a cavalry attack made against another
unit, it may open fire at longer ranges.</p>

<p>“Fire at will is the principal kind of fire to be used in warding off
cavalry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page315">[315]</span></p>

<p><b>France.</b> Infantry, no matter in what formation it may happen to be,
has nothing to fear from hostile cavalry, even if the latter is in superior
numbers, provided the infantry remains cool, well in hand, and makes
good use of its fire.</p>

<p>When cavalry surprises infantry, the effect is as great as of old.
Infantry should therefore carefully protect itself in all situations of combat,
especially during critical moments.</p>

<p>If cavalry is reported, infantry can guard against all contingencies by
echeloning. It should not allow itself to be diverted from its task so long
as the cavalry does not begin an attack.</p>

<p>Any disposition that enables infantry to change front quickly to meet
a charge, and to deliver a strong fire, is calculated to stop even the boldest
cavalry.</p>

<p>When fighting dismounted cavalry, it is considered desirable for the
infantry to advance quickly to medium and short ranges for the purpose
of firing upon the cavalry as it mounts.</p>

<p><b>Russia.</b> Nothing prescribed.</p>

<p><b>Japan.</b> Infantry which, while engaged with the enemy, is forced
to discontinue its movement or to change its formation for the purpose
of warding off hostile cavalry, has already suffered a partial defeat. Only
those fractions that are absolutely necessary for repulsing the cavalry should
take up the fight against it.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VIII. INFANTRY VERSUS ARTILLERY.</h3>

</div><!--chapter-->

<h4>1. THE PASSAGE OF INFANTRY THROUGH ARTILLERY
LINES.</h4>

<p>The artillery of a mobilized German army corps with its
twenty-four batteries takes up approximately 2500 m. of the
front of about 4000 m. available for the corps. When the
ground is unfavorable, the front available for the other arms
may be still further reduced. All remedies suggested for reducing
the frontage required by artillery offer no real solution
of the difficulty; in fact, they have resulting drawbacks,
such as the reduction to ten paces of the interval between
guns, and the posting of artillery in two lines, one in rear of
the other. On account of these drawbacks, a commander will
avail himself of these remedies only in case of the most urgent
necessity. The question as to how infantry can best pass
through these long artillery lines is therefore of especial interest.
While artillery will generally seek commanding positions
and avoid covered terrain, infantry will make use of depressions
and cover as the natural routes of advance for passing by batteries
in action and for deploying subsequently in front of them.
In this case the solution of the problem is simple. The difficulties
are disproportionately greater when terrain impassable
for artillery is lacking. Nothing could be more desirable for
hostile artillery which has adjusted its fire upon our batteries,
than for the intervals between our guns to become suddenly
filled with infantry, whereupon our artillery, until now under
fire, would have to cease firing so as not to endanger our infantry.
This pause in the fire will be more noticeable, when
our artillery has not yet succeeded in gaining a superiority of
fire over the hostile guns; and its length will depend upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span>
depth of the infantry formation. In this case the infantry
cannot avoid heavy losses as it must cross the fire-swept space
in rear of the guns, and soon thereafter must enter the zone of
the opponent’s actual “fire for effect,” besides losing for the
time being the support of its own artillery fire. It is obvious
that for infantry to advance in deployed lines through artillery
in action, condemns the latter to long silence, and even exposes it
to the danger of being placed altogether out of action. Infantry
can pass through artillery lines at certain points only, its passage
being subject to an agreement between the infantry and
artillery commanders. It is advisable to have those batteries
cease firing whose fire has the least influence on the course
of the artillery combat. It is, however, of the utmost importance
that the fire of all hostile batteries which possibly could
fire on our infantry, be kept down by the increased fire of our
artillery. In this manner, we may perhaps be able to draw the
fire of the hostile artillery away from those points at which
our infantry is to pass through our artillery line. This is
especially important. It will also be advantageous to designate
successively, different points in the artillery line for the
passage of infantry. This should be done for two reasons:
first, in order that a favorable target whose re-appearance
the hostile batteries could await with loaded guns, may
not be presented to the enemy at one point for a prolonged
period; second, in order that movements by the flank on the
part of the infantry may be obviated. The column of squads
would be a suitable formation in which two battalions of infantry
could simultaneously pass through the line of guns
approximately within the space occupied by one battery. These
battalions should then at once deploy, executing front into line
toward their respective outer flanks. The guns can resume
firing only when their infantry has reached a point 3-400 m.
in front of them. The artillery will be able to resume its fire
earlier when it is posted in rear of a crest, and for this reason
such points should be selected for the passage of infantry.</p>

A lecture delivered by Major <span class="smcap">C. E. D. Budworth</span>, R.A., at the Royal
Artillery Institution, on December 3, 1908, entitled, <cite>Infantry Formations in the
Attack: from an Artilleryman’s Point of View</cite>, contains some interesting information.
The lecture mentioned appeared in <cite>The Journal of the Royal Artillery</cite> for
February, 1909. <i>Translator</i>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In almost every attack, infantry will be obliged to advance
for considerable distances under artillery fire without being able
to take advantage of cover. It should guard against being
surprised by artillery fire while in an unsuitable formation.</p>

<p>In the first place, everything that facilitates the enemy’s
adjustment and observation of fire should be avoided. (See
<a href="#Page119">p. 119</a> supra). To this end, infantry should not remain unnecessarily
long near objects that are clearly visible at a great
distance. If it is noticed that the enemy is beginning to adjust
his fire on some prominent feature of the terrain, that point
should be passed as quickly as possible; the same is true of a
plain in the enemy’s zone of fire. Narrow columns, separated
by intervals of 50 m., their heads not on the same line, are advantageous.
This formation prevents shrapnel from simultaneously
striking two columns, and makes it difficult for the
enemy to judge the relative position of the smoke from the
burst of his shrapnel with respect to the target. This increases
the difficulties of the enemy’s observation of fire, as it is not
easy for him to determine whether his shots go over or fall
short. A shallow echelon formation (about 50 m. deep, as used
in Russia, for example) is valueless for reducing losses, owing
to the depth of the beaten zone of modern projectiles.</p>

<p>The narrowest possible front should be presented to the
enemy when within his zone of fire.</p>

<p>It is moreover desirable to make the further observation
of fire difficult for the hostile artillery, and to diminish the
effect of his projectiles at the target (see <a href="#Page120">p. 120</a> supra) by
taking up suitable formations. Broad, shallow formations
were suitable against the shell fire of the past. However, they
had the great drawback of considerably facilitating the observation
of shots falling short or going over, as the smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page319">[319]</span>
from the burst hid the target in the first case, and as the
target appeared silhouetted against the smoke from the burst
in the second. The cone of dispersion of the modern base
charge shrapnel combines comparatively small lateral spread
with great effect in depth. The effect of a well-placed shrapnel
may be confined to one target, and that of projectiles bursting
in the intervals reduced by taking up a formation in which
narrow columns (columns of squads) are separated by wide intervals
(up to 50 m.).</p>

<div class="container w30em">

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo319.png" alt="Columns" />

</div><!--container-->

<p>The range is determined or verified by bracketing; that is,
by enclosing the target between shots which, fired at a known
difference of range, strike respectively, short of and beyond
the target. In France this is done either by battery salvo or by
piece. In the former case, the French distribute the fire
equally over the entire space which they wish to cover with
fire; hence, they do not direct it upon the individual columns,<span class="pagenum" id="Page320">[320]</span>
especially when they employ indirect laying, their favorite
mode of procedure. It is in this kind of fire especially that
narrow columns, separated by wide intervals, are a great
advantage, because it is pure accident if a projectile falls so
that its burst can be observed. Moreover, when the columns
are not abreast of each other, the observations of bursts may be
contradictory. Thus, in one salvo, “over” and “short” bursts
may be obtained, especially if several bursts could not be reliably
observed, and the salvo will have to be repeated. When
a projectile bursts “short,” immediately in front of the 1st
company, for example, it may be assumed that the next projectile
will be fired at a range increased by 100-200 m. The
1st company should therefore move to the front at double
time, the 2nd and 3rd likewise, while the 4th executes platoons
front into line and takes to cover in anticipation of an “over”
shot. The “over” meant for the 1st company will then be
the signal for the 4th company to rush forward. <i>The following
general rule may be given: A projectile bursting “over”
or just “short” of the target requires that the force fired
upon move quickly; a projectile bursting far “short” of the target
requires that cover be taken.</i> The platoon and squad leaders
of the attacking force should not betray its presence by
standing upright; the force should disappear absolutely without
leaving a trace.</p>

<p>A force cannot, in the long run, prevent artillery from
effecting an adjustment of fire upon it; all it can do is to
postpone the beginning of the fire for effect.</p>

<p>Fire for effect is of three kinds:</p>

<p>1. “Progressive fire” (<i>tir progressif</i>).<a id="FNanchor316" href="#Footnote316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> In this fire, after
establishing a bracket (as a rule, one of 200 m.), every piece
fires two rounds at each of four ranges, viz., at a range 100 m.
less than the short limit of the bracket, at both ranges of the
bracket, and at a range 100 m. greater than the long limit of the
bracket. For example, if a bracket has been established for<span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span>
the target at 3000 and 3200 m., the battery would fire at 2900,
3000, 3200, and 3300 m.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote316" href="#FNanchor316" class="label">[316]</a> Called “Zone Fire” in our field artillery. <i>Translator</i>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>2. “Sweeping” (<i>fauchage</i>) is employed when it is desired
to cover a broader zone. In this every gun fires three
rounds at each of the ranges designated. The first round is
fired with the line of sight directed on the right portion of the
target (or on the aiming point). Before firing each of the
succeeding rounds, the direction of the piece is changed to the
left by three turns of the traversing handwheel. At the next
range this process is reversed, the direction of the piece being
changed to the right by three turns of the traversing handwheel
after each round. At 2500 m., for example, a battery
can cover, in this manner, a space twice the width of its own
front.</p>

<p>3. “Fire at successive ranges” (searching fire). In this
fire salvos or volleys are delivered at the target at a number of
ranges to be designated by the battery commander.<a id="FNanchor317" href="#Footnote317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote317" href="#FNanchor317" class="label">[317]</a> The Belgian Drill Regulations (1907) give the following details in regard
to the fire effect of a French four gun battery: In “progressive fire” (<i>tir
progressif</i>), 32 rounds cover a space 100 m. wide and 400 m. deep (1 fragment
covers 6 sq. m.). When direct laying is employed, one fragment covers 2 sq.
m. In “progressive fire with sweeping” (<i>tir progressif avec fauchage</i>), 48
shrapnel cover a space 200 m. wide and 400 m. deep, each fragment covering 8
sq. m. Depending upon the range, 1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> to 5 minutes are required to secure
adjustment. (See <a href="#Page119">p. 119</a> supra).</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>During the Russo-Japanese war, all close order formations
proved unsuitable under artillery fire, except when the terrain
afforded cover. The Japanese infantry recognized very soon
that the best protection against artillery fire lay in constant
motion (irregular rushes made by small units) and in wide
extension. The following procedure, employed at Yoshirei on
July 31st, 1904, seems worthy of imitation:<a id="FNanchor318" href="#Footnote318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> The several
platoons of the companies followed each other in deployed
lines at distances of 200-300 m. When they had to cross
open ground in order to reach a designated line, the platoons
sought to advance by squads, whose men were deployed at intervals
of 5-10 paces and who moved at a rapid gait interrupted
by breathing spells. The men invariably assembled
when cover was reached. The losses were insignificant. The
Russians also made use of a similar procedure after their first
disastrous experiences. In many instances the platoons ran
forward in single rank. “Change of gait and direction, as
well as the use of loose irregular skirmish lines make it difficult
for the artillery to hit anything.” (Par. 450 German
I. D. R.).</p>

<p>These formations made it possible to advance at a walk
to within 3000 m. of a hostile position; beyond that an advance
by rushes had to be resorted to, in which the attacking force
avoided showing itself simultaneously in long lines. The
simplest scheme might be to move forward in column of
sections, each section in skirmish line. Formation “a” is well
adapted for quickly crossing fire swept places, and when there
is hope of re-forming the column subsequently. Formation “c”
is suitable for quickly deploying from company column. However,
the last-named formation no longer guarantees a proper
leading of the company, and quite naturally does not absolutely
prevent losses. After the Japanese 5th Brigade (Nambu) had
taken possession of Yuhuntun<a id="FNanchor319" href="#Footnote319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> and the three houses during the
night of March 6/7, 1905, the following dispositions for attack
were made by the Russians about noon on the 7th: On
the right, the 5th and 10th Rifle Regiments, in five lines, each
consisting of one battalion (total depth of the formation 600
m.); in the center, the 123rd Infantry (Koslov) of which the
companies of three battalions were deployed in single rank
lines, each consisting of one company, with the men at intervals
of from 3 to 5 paces, the companies in rear of each
other at distances of 100 paces; the IVth Battalion, similarly
formed, was posted in echelon to the left rear. The 124th<span class="pagenum" id="Page324">[324]</span>
Infantry advanced on the left flank. The Koslov Regiment,
advancing without hesitation in quick time and at attention,
was fired on by three Japanese batteries while it was moving
from 4000 to 2000 m. The regiment lost about 600 men. This
loss is insignificant when the size of the target (about 600 m.
wide and 1000 m. deep) is considered. The Japanese did not
care to become involved in a serious infantry action and
therefore evacuated the place. It would have been better to
advance by rushes with smaller units, as the terrain afforded
no cover whatever. Whenever the Japanese had sufficient
time, they crossed such plains singly, one by one, and then
assembled under cover for the attack.</p>

<h4>3. FIRING ON ARTILLERY IN POSITION</h4>

<p class="noindent">was in the past a pet fire problem. The effect of frontal fire
on artillery whose guns are protected by shields is so small
that the expenditure of ammunition is not justifiable.<a id="FNanchor320" href="#Footnote320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The
gap between the steel shields of the French field gun is not
large enough to exert a noticeable influence. Steel shields,
3 mm. thick, afford protection against steel jacketed bullets
fired at or beyond 300 m.; against “S” and “D” projectiles they
afford protection, it is said, beyond 500 m. only. Machine
guns directing continuous fire on a point may obtain better results.
According to firing tests 3 mm. armor plate can be
pierced up to 1000 m. only by special projectiles (solid steel
projectiles and those having a steel core), the adoption of
which is precluded on practical grounds (variations in sectional
density, and difficulty of manufacture).<a id="FNanchor321" href="#Footnote321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> For this reason, it
is better to leave the task of destroying shielded batteries, even
when they are in the open, to one’s own artillery, than to attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page325">[325]</span>
them with infantry. The fire effect of the infantry is
not noticeably increased when delivered obliquely against the
front of the battery. (Par. 184 German I. D. R.). In Germany
the gun commander and cannoneer No. 3, who is posted
at the trail, are then especially endangered; but in order to
flank the guns effectively and to reach in rear of the shields
with its fire, the infantry must move to a flank a distance at
least equal to <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> of the range, and even then the fire effect
is very small. The effect may even be entirely nullified when
the flanking fire is delivered from the side on which the caisson
bodies are posted. In this case it suffices to push forward
the caisson body to protect the personnel. It is a good plan<span class="pagenum" id="Page326">[326]</span>
for infantry to direct its fire on the limbers and the reserve.
And again, infantry should not let any opportunity pass to
fire on artillery in motion or in the act of limbering or unlimbering
within effective range. Guns moved by hand into
positions from which direct laying can be employed for the
purpose of warding off the infantry attack, offer particularly
favorable targets. Infantry that is to capture artillery must
approach its objective by means of irregular rushes made by
small groups, and increase its fire to the utmost intensity when
the limbers are brought up to the guns. The effect of artillery
fire is small under 200 m., in the absence of canister.<a id="FNanchor322" href="#Footnote322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote320" href="#FNanchor320" class="label">[320]</a> Even prior to the adoption of shields it was demonstrated that infantry
was unable to destroy the matériel of batteries so as to render them immobile;
it could only interfere with the <i>personnel</i>, but could not demolish the batteries.</p>

<p>The disaster which overtook Trautmann’s Battery at St.
Hubert, during the battle of Gravelotte, demonstrates how difficult
it is to unlimber on open ground when under effective
infantry and artillery fire; but, if five limbers with their teams
had not stampeded, perhaps it might have been possible after
a while, for the battery to reopen fire. Hasse’s Battery, also
at St. Hubert, was rendered incapable of moving in a short
time, but, in spite of the greatest difficulties, managed to continue
its fire for about two hours, though with only a part of
the guns. Gnügge’s Battery managed to unlimber under cover
of a garden wall at St. Hubert and to maintain itself there
under enfilading infantry fire till the end of the battle. Trautmann’s
Battery lost 17 men and 37 horses; Hasse’s Battery,
38 men and 77 horses; and Gnügge’s Battery, 15 men and
40 horses.<a id="FNanchor323" href="#Footnote323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>Unlimbering under uninterrupted hostile fire at short range
will always produce conditions similar to those in Trautmann’s
Battery, and in the two British batteries of Colonel Long at
Colenso.<a id="FNanchor324" href="#Footnote324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> These two batteries did not cease firing because
they had suffered too heavily, but only because they had expended
all their limber ammunition and the caissons were unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page327">[327]</span>
to come up. It was impossible for these batteries to limber
up under the hostile fire. It was likewise impossible to destroy
a battery, though without protecting shields, even when great
quantities of ammunition were expended.</p>

<p>At the battle of Beaumont, the artillery of the 7th Infantry
Division suffered heavy losses. “Although the first caisson sections
were up and the men with them were detailed to assist
in working the guns, the gun squads in both batteries had
dwindled down to 2 or 3 men each by 1 P. M., <i>i.e.</i>, within half
an hour.” Immediately after the French attack had been repulsed,
one of these batteries was able to accompany the advancing
infantry, however, while the other (the 4th Light
Battery) could not move its guns until an hour later, as it had
lost 29 men and 34 horses.<a id="FNanchor325" href="#Footnote325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> This example proves again that
when artillery has once managed to go into position and to open
fire, it cannot be annihilated by infantry alone, and therefore
need not fear to take up a more than temporary position in
the first line.</p>

<p>The best way for artillery to protect itself against annoyance
from hostile infantry fire is to push forward an infantry
screen, even if only a weak one. In the days when
batteries had no shields, this screen enabled artillery to devote
its entire attention to the principal target without regard to
hostile infantry. At the present time, especially in positions
in rear of a crest and in long artillery lines, the principal object
of such a screen is to prevent hostile patrols from molesting the
artillery. Small detachments posted at wide intervals are sufficient
for this purpose. The flanks and rear are now as in
the past the vulnerable points and are most exposed to
daring, sudden attacks, even if only made by weak hostile detachments.

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The defense may repulse the enemy, but only the attack
can annihilate him. The decision as to whether the force is to
attack or stand on the defensive depends upon the tactical situation
and the will of the commander, and not upon numerical
superiority, of which one is not aware, as a rule, until after the
battle.<a id="FNanchor327" href="#Footnote327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Determined attacks, again and again repeated, in spite
of all failures, are the surest means of gaining victory and of
preventing the enemy from becoming aware of his superiority.
Only pressing reasons (marked hostile superiority, necessity
for awaiting approaching reinforcements, or the failure of an
attack), and never favorable terrain conditions, should determine
a commander to stand on the defensive. In defense the
eventual assumption of the offensive is kept constantly in view.
A commander who voluntarily stands on the defensive for the
purpose of letting the opponent attack, and then attacks him
in turn, reaps only the disadvantages and never the advantages
of both the offensive and the defensive.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The attack may take various forms, depending upon
whether the dispositions have to be made under hostile fire
(surprise and rencontre), or whether the enemy has renounced
the initiative and awaits the attack in a deployed formation, or
in a position prepared for defense (deliberately planned attack).
In the last case the attack requires more careful preparation
and in many instances even necessitates the employment
of special auxiliaries (such as guns capable of high angle fire,
and engineer trains). However, the advance of a strong firing
line to within assaulting distance of the enemy, and the uninterrupted
fight for the superiority of fire, are common to all attacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page330">[330]</span></p>

<p>Aside from the attack against an enemy in position and
the rencontre there is an attack formation more closely resembling
the rencontre in character, which may be called the
<i>abridged attack</i>.<a id="FNanchor328" href="#Footnote328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> This attack formation is used in forestalling
the enemy in occupying important points, in preventing

the enemy, in warding off a hostile surprise, in relieving
the pressure on a neighboring force, etc. It is moreover appropriate
where the conformation of the ground or the time of

<p>Insufficient reconnaissance may place a force in a situation
where it will be obliged to go into action directly from
route column or from a formation unsuitable for combat,
against an enemy who unexpectedly opens a lively fire at short
range, thus increasing the moral effect of the surprise by
actually inflicting losses. The force which is taken by surprise
will without doubt overrate the seriousness of the situation
and will be inclined to overestimate the strength and morale of
the opposing force. This must be taken into account in coming
to a decision.</p>

<p>Above all else, it is important to develop, as promptly as
possible, a fire effect at least equivalent to that of the enemy, to
let the troops regain confidence, and to secure the initiative.
A bold decision is best calculated to extricate a force from such<span class="pagenum" id="Page331">[331]</span>
a critical situation.<a id="FNanchor331" href="#Footnote331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> It is of little use to deploy, take cover, and
open fire, when the enemy is well concealed; a decision to retire
is still less to be approved, because at short ranges it is bound
to lead to a complete annihilation of the force. As a rule, a
defeat can only be averted, in such a case, by assuming the
offensive and thus repulsing the enemy. The decision for attacking
directly from route column (or, when the enemy is
still at a distance, at least for deploying toward the front) is
the more justifiable, since an enemy who prepares an ambuscade
for us is, as a rule, conscious of his inferiority in numbers,
morale, and training, and resorts to deceit because he
does not dare to meet us in the open. Therefore, overwhelm
the enemy with fire and then charge him with the bayonet. An
impetuous advance may perhaps intimidate him, and our losses
will be less, at any rate, than if we turn our backs on him and
await our fate in what is at best but a poor position, as it is
taken up, as a rule, during the first moment of panic. However,
even if a force that is taken by surprise cannot avert
disaster by making a determined counter-attack, it can at
least save its honor and morale. This is equally true of the
rencontre on the battlefield.</p>

use the bayonet; if he is still at a distance, fire on him, and then use the
bayonet.” <span class="smcap">Dragomirov</span>.</p>

<p>During the battle of <b>Noisseville</b> there occurred an unusually instructive
episode, the disastrous results of which could have been easily avoided
if the mounted officers on duty with the force had been sent out to reconnoiter.
Six companies of the 44th Infantry (Prussian) were advancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page332">[332]</span>
from <b>Flanville</b> against <b>Montoy</b>. On the French side, the 62nd Infantry
was likewise advancing against Flanville and had arrived at Montoy when
the 44th Infantry (Prussian) very unexpectedly appeared on its left flank.
The French regimental commander decided to attack at once. “The Prussian
detachments advancing south of Montoy were about to scale the west
slope of the ravine near there, when, at very short range, they suddenly
encountered the rapid fire of a dense French skirmish line, which was
immediately followed by the counter-attack, consisting of columns in close
order. At the same moment, the left flank of the Prussians was attacked
from the south, and other hostile columns advanced from the park through
the west entrance of the village. The Prussian skirmish lines were repulsed
in an instant, and thrown into complete confusion. The hostile
fire had an annihilating effect on account of the short range, and the situation
was at once completely reversed. The Prussians sought in vain to
gain a firm foothold in the eastern outskirts of the village of Montoy.
Their losses were heavy. The four companies (3rd, 9th, 11th and 12th)
of the 44th Infantry numbered in all 18 officers and 840 men; they lost 7
officers and 480 men, of which number 1 officer and 82 men (all unharmed)
were taken prisoners. The 9th Company suffered least; but the 3rd, 11th
and 12th Companies (44th Infantry) lost in all 55.5% of their effective
strength, the 3rd Company even losing 67%.”<a id="FNanchor334" href="#Footnote334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>This surprise could without doubt have been avoided. If the 44th
Infantry had sent mounted men ahead, it would have been in a position
to let the French walk into its fire. Soon after this occurrence, the
French infantry also unexpectedly received flanking fire from Flanville,
which forced it to abandon the pursuit after suffering some losses.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>When two forces unexpectedly collide in close country,
the advantage rests decidedly with the one that opens fire and
advances to the charge first. This onslaught with cold steel
should become second nature to the troops. In traversing close
country, a force should be in a formation that enables it to
develop an adequate fire and to make a charge in compact formation.
A line formation is entirely unsuitable, as a rule, on
account of the difficulties of the terrain to be overcome, and in
a skirmish line the officers cannot properly control the men.</p>

<p>For passing through thinly scattered timber without underbrush,<a id="FNanchor335" href="#Footnote335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>
company column is a suitable formation, and for
dense woods platoons advancing either abreast or echeloned,
each platoon in line of squads in columns of files. If the platoons<span class="pagenum" id="Page333">[333]</span>
or sections were to advance in single file, the columns would
be too long, and it would be next to impossible to maintain the
intervals. The six or eight small columns of files of a platoon
are, on the other hand, close enough together to keep each other
in view; besides, they are easily and quickly deployed for firing
and charging, and can meander through the woods more readily
than an organization in close order. Moreover, the leaders can
exercise better control over the men than in skirmish line, which
invariably bunches up at the places that are most easily passed,
while connection is not maintained at all at other points and
march direction and cohesion is lost. (See the passage of the
Bois de Givodeau during the battle of Beaumont).<a id="FNanchor336" href="#Footnote336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>“Uncertainty and haziness of the situation are the rule in
war. During marches in campaign the opponents will frequently
not gain detailed information of each other until they
come into actual contact. Thus the rencontre develops out of
a collision of route columns.” (Par. 352 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>Both forces are marching toward each other, and the collision
occurs frequently at a point not intended by either; as
every minute brings the heads of the two columns closer together
no time is to be lost. The commander who desires to
wait until he can come to a decision consonant with the results
of the reconnaissance will arrive too late. The tactical situation
in its entirety determines whether or not an attack should<span class="pagenum" id="Page334">[334]</span>
be made. If we do not take advantage of the fleeting moment
the enemy will surely do so, and, as a rule, he will not be any
better prepared for action than we are. Frequently the deployment
from route column is not made because the commander
desires it, but because it is necessary in order to avert a crisis
in the leading line. The commander who is acting under hostile
pressure should endeavor to regain the upper hand as
quickly as possible so that he can dispose of the troops of the
main body with a definite object in view. In a rencontre, the
advantage rests almost invariably with the commander who
quickly sizes up the situation, attacks promptly, and succeeds
in throwing the opponent on the defensive. A bold, impetuous
attack, which would lead to disaster in the presence of an
opponent already deployed, may, in this case, be productive
of victory. The direction in which the attack is made is of
less importance than a prompt decision on the part of the commander
and the simultaneous launching of the whole force in
a definite direction. We must take the terrain as we find it.
In covered terrain, the effect of the surprise will be increased
still more, while in open country, the preparatory stage of the
combat will soon lose that character, because the side which
has an advantage as regards terrain will make use of it, and
the conviction will force itself upon the opponent that victory
cannot be gained by an impetuous attack alone. It will be
easy for a commander to come to a decision as to the action to
be taken if he is conscious of his own strength or fears that
the enemy desires to avoid an attack. (The commanders of the
advanced troops of the IIIrd Army Corps at Vionville). <i>The
rencontre increases the difficulties of troop leading, but makes
the attack easier for the troops.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The difference between a deliberately planned attack and
a rencontre is most clearly apparent in the conduct of the advance
guard. Its task is to secure the prospective artillery<span class="pagenum" id="Page335">[335]</span>
position and to create favorable conditions for the combat of
the main body. This requires that ground be gained to the
front so as to enable the main body to deploy while moving
forward. In addition, the advance guard should seize and
hold important points, without, however, anticipating the intentions
of the commander of the whole force. It is moreover
desirable for the advance guard to interfere with the hostile
deployment. Points lying on the flanks or in advance of the
artillery position, especially if they command the latter, should
be quickly seized; when necessary, the advance guard must
fight for their possession. Its commander should quickly pick
out the points that are important for this purpose; he should,
by no means, be satisfied always to begin the fight where the
point of the advance guard happens to be. Under certain circumstances
the main body will have to concentrate for action
farther to the rear so as to hasten the deployment and to take
advantage of favorable terrain. When the enemy has an undeniable
start in deployment, the commander may decide to
let the opponent advance to the attack, and then bring about
the decision by simultaneously launching his main body. Only
thus can one in the long run avoid fighting superior numbers
with an inferior force. (Par. 360 German I. D. R.). It is
much easier to decide whether this or that point is of importance,
than to answer the question as to whether the strength
of the advance guard will suffice for the task of taking it.
The reports of the cavalry in regard to the enemy’s strength
and the composition and formation of his columns, will scarcely
furnish an adequate basis for a pertinent answer to this
question. Moreover, one will usually not be able to tell, until
after the action has commenced, how far the hostile deployment
has progressed. But, in any case, long hostile firing lines
demand caution. However, a start in deployment is not indicated
by the combat frontage alone. A factor of far greater
importance is which force has been most successful in making
preparations for going into action by developing its main body
and by having artillery near at hand. It is artillery that clears
up the situation. When an infantry division encounters a<span class="pagenum" id="Page336">[336]</span>
hostile force deployed on a front of 400-600 m., this does not
necessarily mean that the entire division must systematically
concentrate for action, as this would cause a considerable loss
of time, thus giving the enemy a great advantage. <i>The general
situation and the mission of a force are of greater importance
for the commander’s decision, than the state of readiness for
action of the opposing forces.</i></p>

<p><i>Issue of orders.</i> See <cite>Taktik</cite>, V, p. 197.</p>

<p>The advance guard must be promptly informed of the
intentions of the commander (<i>i.e.</i>, whether he intends to attack,
to concentrate for attack farther to the rear, or to let
the enemy attack<a id="FNanchor338" href="#Footnote338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>) and of the location of the prospective artillery
position. The attack order should be withheld until the
combat of the advance guard has sufficiently cleared the situation,
but a development of the force should be ordered at once.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote338" href="#FNanchor338" class="label">[338]</a> Par. 350 German I. D. R.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The advanced detachments should endeavor to gain a
start in deployment over the enemy and cover the advancing
artillery in front and flank, by quickly deploying strong firing
lines and pushing machine guns to the front. After they have
done this, they should promptly advance to the attack. Through
this, our firing line, while in the act of deploying, runs the
serious risk of suddenly encountering, at short range, the fire
of superior hostile troops, at a time when all the troops approaching
the field are still too far distant to increase its fire
power.<a id="FNanchor339" href="#Footnote339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Whether the quickly formed firing lines should at
once move forward to the attack in a rencontre, depends upon
the impressions received by the commander. His dispositions
should be such as to compel the enemy to disclose his available
forces at an early moment. Every fighting line is so sensitive
to fire simultaneously delivered against its front and flank, that
an attempt to turn the hostile position will instantly force the
enemy to take counter-measures. If the enemy is unable to
keep pace with us in deploying a firing line, if he is unable to
deploy skirmish lines as dense as ours, this state of affairs<span class="pagenum" id="Page337">[337]</span>
should induce our commander to proceed to the attack; if the
reverse state of affairs exists, he should await the arrival of
reinforcements. But in order to obtain this insight into the
existing situation the troops must get close to the enemy. Such
an insight into the hostile dispositions cannot be gained at
long range. The extent of a hostile position may perhaps be
determined at long range with the best field glasses, but the
strength and power of resistance of the enemy can never be
gauged in this manner. If one threatens to push an attack
home, however, the enemy will be compelled to show his hand.
When opposed by an enemy whose strength is unknown, it
will unquestionably be necessary to approach to the extreme
limit of short ranges. From here the dispositions of the enemy
may be clearly recognized, and, in addition, at 600-800 m., a
firing line that has made a lodgment in some feature of the
terrain will not as yet be exposed to annihilating losses. Misconceptions
are scarcely to be avoided in such a situation. One
must trust to luck and take some risks. On the other hand, the
training of the infantry should afford the assurance that it
will not give up the position it has once reached; it should
firmly hold the ground gained, and persevere.<a id="FNanchor340" href="#Footnote340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote339" href="#FNanchor339" class="label">[339]</a> This induces the British
<cite>Infantry Training</cite> to prescribe that in a rencontre
a concentration for attack should invariably be ordered.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote340" href="#FNanchor340" class="label">[340]</a> Military history furnishes a multitude of examples of the fact that a
force can persevere in spite of the most galling fire (St. Privat. Gorni Dubniac).
A reverse does not occur, as a rule, until the advent of unforeseen circumstances.
The Brigade of Highlanders held out for hours at Magersfontain, and an
insignificant change of front on the right flank subsequently caused the whole
line to retire. See <cite>Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften</cite>, 32, p. 74.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>When infantry is compelled to go into action, the necessity
of occupying important supporting points and of gaining
ground for the concentration for action, requires a broad front
to be covered. (Par. 357 German I. D. R.). The artillery,
which will arrive soon thereafter, will then bring relief to the
infantry in critical situations.</p>

<p>In every rencontre there comes a moment when the fight
is at a standstill. At this moment an attentive observer may
notice that, although it is impossible to push the attack home
without further reinforcements, the space in which the concentration
for action is to take place, is secured against a<span class="pagenum" id="Page338">[338]</span>
hostile attack, or that the enemy has been deprived of the
initiative and has been thrown on the defensive. This is the
moment in which the commander regains the initiative and in
which, by means of an <i>attack order</i>, he can dispose of the
troops of the main body as he sees fit. <i>The “rencontre” differs
from the “deliberately planned attack,” in that, in the
latter, the concentration for action can proceed smoothly as
desired by the commander, while in a rencontre the opponent,
for the time being, dictates the course of action. Therefore
the commander should make efforts to free himself from this
restraint, i.e., he should endeavor to launch his troops in a
manner not influenced by the dispositions of the enemy.</i></p>

<p>The degree of control which a commander retains over
the course of the combat depends upon the promptness with
which he gains a general idea of the situation. For this, if for
no other reason, he should be as near the head of the column
as possible while on the march. The troops sent first into
action, supported by the artillery, must put every available man
into the fight, in order to repulse attacks made by the enemy
and to enable the commander to launch the main body as an
entity. In any case, the battalions of the main body should
not be successively thrown into the fight as soon as they arrive,
for the purpose of overcoming a temporary crisis, or for relieving
the advance guard from a dilemma. The machine gun
batteries, whose employment was particularly important during
the preparatory stage of the fight, should be withdrawn as
early as possible so as to be available as a reserve in the hands
of the commander.</p>

<p>In bringing the main body into action, deployments by
the flank should be avoided. The deployment should be initiated
by subordinate units (in an infantry division, by regiments)
moving out of the route column and toward the objective
points determined by the purpose of the combat.<a id="FNanchor341" href="#Footnote341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

column and ready for action. Further action is then not only permissible but

<h5>Provisions of Various Regulations.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In all the regulations, those of Germany excepted, the rencontre is
treated with marked reserve.</p>

<p><b>Austria.</b> “When a collision occurs with an opponent who is likewise
in the act of advancing&mdash;<i>rencontre</i>&mdash;the different parts of the force and
their subdivisions must make strenuous efforts to advance in the designated
direction. In a rencontre, it will be proper to concentrate the main forces,
prior to making the attack, only in case it becomes apparent during the
preparatory stage of the action that the enemy has gained a visible start
in deployment. The endeavor to forestall the enemy, and the necessity
of promptly reinforcing the troops already engaged, will often curtail
or preclude the preparatory concentration of the main body in a rencontre,
and force the commander to permit at least parts of his approaching troops
to go directly into action.” If conditions are eminently favorable for the
enemy at the point where the collision occurs, it may sometimes be more
desirable to stand provisionally on the defensive with the advance guard
until other troops come up.</p>

<p>“Under such circumstances, it may even be advisable to withdraw
the troops covering the march; but in that event, the relation of the force
to neighboring columns should be considered.”</p>

<p><b>France.</b> The commander should decide promptly whether to attack,
to stand on the defensive, or to avoid an engagement for the time being.
The regulations do not provide for employing the troops directly from
route column. The advance guard is frequently thrown on its own resources;
it is often forced to fight on a very broad front, and to place all
of its troops into action at the very beginning of an engagement for the
purpose of seizing and holding supporting points necessary for the subsequent
deployment.</p>

<p>During the <b>Boer War</b> (1899-1902), the British infantry always attacked
positions prepared for defense. Aside from the superannuated
fire tactics and deficient marksmanship training of the British, their failures
in the early engagements of the war may generally be traced to the
following <span class="nowrap">causes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Insufficient reconnaissance. This caused British detachments to
be surprised, in a number of cases, by fire at short range. (Brigade of
the Guards at <b>Modder River</b>). In many instances, the British forces
were even surprised by fire while in close order formations. (Hart’s
Brigade at <b>Colenso</b>).</p>

<p>2. Pure frontal attacks, in which equal forces were frequently pitted
against each other. (<b>Modder River</b>, <b>Magersfontain</b>, <b>Colenso</b>).</p>

<p>3. Insufficient protection of the flanks by echelons against fire surprises
carried out by small detachments.</p>

<p>4. Insufficient coöperation of the artillery and infantry.</p>

<p>5. Isolated attacks made by brigades (consisting of 4 battalions).
The employment of several brigades simultaneously for concerted action
was a rare exception.</p>

<p>6. Insufficient support of the firing line. A timely reinforcement of
an organization that had already been shaken never did occur.</p>

<p>7. Hesitating use of reserves in the crisis of the fight. At <b>Magersfontain</b>
only 8<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> battalions out of 13, and at <b>Colenso</b> only 6 battalions
out of 16<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>, had been seriously engaged. When <b>Spionskop</b> was evacuated,
11 battalions had not as yet been engaged. The attacks were begun,
but not pushed home.</p>

<h5>The Infantry Attack in the Russo-Japanese War.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The combat tactics of the Russian infantry<a id="FNanchor345" href="#Footnote345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> (Russian I. D. R. of 1903)
were based on shock action, narrow frontage, and deep formations. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page341">[341]</span>
bayonet training preached by Dragomirov was the result of the belief in
decisive psychological impressions and the consciousness that the Russian
fire tactics, based upon volley fire, were inadequate to annihilate a
well concealed defender. Thus, the endeavor to cross blades with the
opponent as quickly as possible, led to a headlong rush to the front, without
creating the preliminary conditions necessary for pushing the attack
home. The hesitation of the higher commanders to throw in every available
man at the decisive stage, and the tendency, reaching down to the
lowest grades, of creating detachments and separate missions, contrasted
unfavorably with this splendid offensive spirit.</p>

<p>The Japanese infantry was trained according to the letter and spirit
of the German regulations of 1889. It had fought shy of unhealthy tendencies
after the Boer war, cultivated the independence and initiative of
all leaders, and recognized the necessity of night combats and of using
the spade. In addition, the way for success was carefully, almost cautiously,
prepared by the commander-in-chief, who left nothing to chance.
It is easy for subordinate leaders to be bold and daring, when they know
that the commander-in-chief has neglected nothing to ensure victory. The

<p>A change took place in the tactical methods of the Japanese when
the Russian artillery&mdash;whose ballistic properties were superior to those of
its antagonist&mdash;brought a greater number of guns into the field, and when,
in addition, the Japanese infantry became numerically inferior in the
battles after Liao Yang.<a id="FNanchor349" href="#Footnote349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote349" href="#FNanchor349" class="label">[349]</a> The statements in regard to the strength of the opposing forces are still
very contradictory. At Liao Yang 120,000 Japanese confronted 150,000 Russians;
at Mukden the Russians had perhaps 10,000 rifles, 300 field guns, and 100 heavy
pieces of ordnance more than the Japanese.</p>

<p>The task set commanders of armies and leaders of troops by the
government, had to be met by a continuance of the offensive.<a id="FNanchor350" href="#Footnote350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> The
peculiar character of the theater of war made it difficult to maneuver the
enemy out of his strong positions; so at best nothing remained for the
Japanese&mdash;unless they wished to renounce the offensive entirely&mdash;but to
conquer the enemy by attacking him in front. Since the advantages of
the attack&mdash;superior numbers and the freedom of choosing the point of
attack&mdash;were thus dissipated, the victory had to be gained by making use
of defensive expedients. As the demoralizing and retarding effect produced
by fire increased more rapidly than the morale of the assailant,
nothing remained but to intrench and to take advantage of the cover
afforded by darkness as in fortress warfare. Moreover, the inferior
forces available precluded deep formations and necessitated an immediate
development of the entire force in one line. Thus the desire to
push forward resolved itself into an advance along a broad front.
Favored by the purely passive conduct of the Russians, this led to an
envelopment of their flanks and a pressure on their line of retreat. The
Japanese were able to overcome the constantly growing power of resistance
of the Russian defense, because, while strictly adhering to the offensive,
they availed themselves of defensive expedients although their
movements were retarded thereby.</p>

<p>The conduct of the attack was, of course, considerably influenced
by the character of the terrain. The 1st Army, fighting in hilly country,
perhaps remained true longer to regulation formations and long rushes
than the other Japanese forces, but was finally obliged to resort to a wide
extension of closed bodies. The IInd and IVth Armies were differently
situated, as the attack over open plains fell to their lot.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the following details may be given in regard to the
method of attack of the Ist Japanese Army:<a id="FNanchor351" href="#Footnote351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Units were pushed into action
abreast; objective points were assigned to each; and certain lines or points,
according to which they had to maintain touch, were indicated to subordinate
units. To avoid a surprise, if for no other reason, thin firing
lines were formed at the outset, and in a serious attack whole companies,
in dense firing lines capable of developing a strong fire, were at once
thrown in; these advanced to mid ranges in order to open fire, as a rule,
under 1000 m. The Ist army had a special <i>penchant</i> for making rushes of
80-100 m.,<a id="FNanchor352" href="#Footnote352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> usually by entire companies; the assault was, in many
instances, begun as far as 300 m. from the hostile position, and then
pushed home; supports and reserves followed in extended formation, but
assembled promptly on reaching cover. The infantry was disinclined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page343">[343]</span>
intrench during an advance, but never neglected to fortify quickly a captured
position. In the combats of the Ist Army we will find the best
lessons applicable to our conditions.</p>

rushes less than 30-40 m. long. On the other hand, according to the opinion
of von Lüttwitz, the length of rushes will seldom exceed 100 m.</p>

The above shows the great importance of local reconnaissance by infantry,
of which considerably more must be demanded than has been done up<span class="pagenum" id="Page345">[345]</span>
to the present time in European armies. It shows, moreover, the advantages
of thin firing lines during the preparatory stage of the action, and
the insignificant effect produced by shrapnel and long range fire on such
lines in which it is desirable to advance, without halting on the way, to
within 1000 yards of the enemy. The necessity of gaining a superiority
of fire before advancing to the assault, and the necessity of an increased
supply of ammunition, are confirmed anew. It is further demonstrated
that the bayonet of the infantryman is still capable of playing an important
role in battle.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<h4>2. THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH SUCCESS
DEPENDS.</h4>

<p>The Russo-Japanese war confirms the opinion that the
issue of combat is but little influenced by the formations taken
up; that <i>esprit</i> and the determination to conquer are of far
greater importance than any formation. The most difficult task
that infantry can be called upon to perform consists of successfully
pushing home an attack over open ground commanded
by hostile fire. “It would be wrong,” said Fieldmarshal
Moltke, “were one to attempt to lay down in regulations that
a force should not advance over a plain against an enemy
under cover. <i>But every superior commander ought to consider
what such an operation portends.</i>” Heavy losses are
unavoidable in a destructive fire fight lasting for hours.<a id="FNanchor361" href="#Footnote361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> The
attack will not succeed so long as the enemy commands the
plain with his fire. The commander of the attacking force
must find ways and means to wrest this command from the
enemy. All of the battles of recent campaigns have demonstrated
that an attack is bound to succeed if it is thoroughly
prepared by infantry and artillery fire, is undertaken by adequate
forces, and is pushed with determination close to the
enemy; and that such an attack is, in fact, superior to the
defensive. The success of an attack on a position prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page346">[346]</span>
for defense might depend upon the following preliminary
conditions:</p>

<p>(a) Careful reconnaissance, for the purpose of determining
the most favorable direction for the attack.</p>

<p>(b) Occupation of the foreground of the hostile position.
When the foreground is entirely open, an advance must
be made under cover of darkness up to the medium ranges.</p>

<p>(c) Preparation of the infantry attack by the closest
coöperation of infantry and artillery.</p>

<p>(d) Timely determination of the point at which the
decisive attack is to be made.</p>

<p>(e) Careful utilization of the terrain during the advance,
so as to allow of delaying the opening of fire until the
force is as close as possible to the enemy.</p>

<p>(f) Suitable disposition, distribution in depth, and deployment
of a strong force for the purpose of bringing about
a superiority of infantry fire. The organization detailed to
make the attack must have its entire effective strength available
for accomplishing its proper task, and not be compelled
to detach parts for guarding its flanks.</p>

<p>(g) Ensuring concerted and simultaneous action on the
part of the attacking forces. As the enemy has given up any
idea of assuming the offensive, at least for the time being, the
attacker should not allow the advantage to escape him of
choosing time and direction of the attack.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote361" href="#FNanchor361" class="label">[361]</a> General
<span class="smcap">von Schlichting</span>, in his work <cite>Taktische und strategische Grundsätze</cite>,
maintains the opinion&mdash;in contrast to General <span class="smcap">von Scherff</span>&mdash;that open
terrain commanded by hostile fire is impassable for infantry. At any rate,
military history has yet to furnish proof of this.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h4>3. PREPARATION OF THE ATTACK.</h4>

<h5>Reconnaissance. Preparatory Position.</h5>

<p>“If the enemy decides to stand on the defensive, he renounces
the initiative for the time being. The attacker will
then have time to reconnoiter the hostile position and to weigh
all the circumstances that favor the attack. He should not
limit himself to reconnaissance by the cavalry and to observation<span class="pagenum" id="Page347">[347]</span>
through field glasses. Mounted officers’ and infantry officers’
patrols should supplement this reconnaissance, and complete
the information gained as the enemy is approached.”
(Pars. 362 and 363 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>The local reconnaissance (see <a href="#Page248">p. 248</a> supra) should be
conducted with all possible care; timely directions should be
given in regard to it during the approach to the battlefield;<a id="FNanchor362" href="#Footnote362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
the activity of the reconnoitering bodies should continually
increase as the enemy is approached; and the work itself
should be divided in a systematic manner. Excessive thoroughness
may retard reconnaissance work to such an extent,
on short winter days especially, that success may be jeopardized.
(Par. 305 German I. D. R.). As a result freedom of
action will be lost and the energy of the attack weakened. It
would be wholly wrong to postpone the decision for making
the attack until something definite is known of the strength
and dispositions of the enemy. These matters are almost
never cleared up until after the battle. The decision as to
whether or not an attack should be made is determined primarily
by the general situation. (Par. 355 German I. D. R.).
The latter may force a commander to advance promptly without
permitting him to await the results of the reconnaissance.
The character of the terrain and the preparation the enemy
is known to have made, determine whether the commander
ought to attack at once, whether he ought to utilize the cover
of darkness for the advance of the attacking troops, or whether
he ought to attempt to maneuver the defender out of his position.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote362" href="#FNanchor362" class="label">[362]</a> According to experience the reconnaissance work generally flags during

1904 (battle on the Shaho), to attack the Russian army before it had completed
its concentration for battle. The advance guards of the Reserve Division and of
the 5th Division encountered advanced Russian detachments at Kushutsy (Xth
Army Corps), and at Wulitaisy (XVIIth Army Corps), whose weakness was,
however, not recognized. In the belief that the Russian main position had been
encountered, the advance on the hostile position was ordered for the night 10/11th
October, the attack to take place at daybreak on the 11th. 9th Supplement to

<p>In order to guard the reconnoitering troops from being

artillery with better chances of succeeding than in the past.</p>

<p>The assailant should launch as few troops as possible

in a fire fight with the infantry of the hostile main
position, even if the terrain would permit a covered approach
to short range. If the advanced troops allow themselves to be

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A premature deployment impairs the leader’s influence on
the course of the combat and makes it difficult to change the
direction of the attack. Route columns, taking advantage of
all available cover, will, therefore, be retained as long as possible,
and only subordinate units permitted to march directly
toward their proper objectives, until the hostile fire compels a
more extended deployment (development). The preparatory
position is taken up in the last sheltered area in front of the
hostile position, provided that that area is large enough to
accommodate the attacking force when deployed for action, and
to shield it from the observation and the fire of the enemy.</p>

<p>In country generally devoid of cover, infantry will have
to be placed in a preparatory position when three kilometers
or more from the enemy, even when the latter’s artillery will
in all probability be neutralized by our own.</p>

<p>“In order to ensure the concerted advance of the various
units into the preparatory position, it is advisable, especially
in close country, to have them move from one covered position
to another. If this is done, units whose march was favored
by the nature of the ground, will not arrive prematurely
within dangerous proximity of the enemy, while others who
had farther to go, or whose advance was difficult, are still a
considerable distance to the rear. The leader should make his<span class="pagenum" id="Page351">[351]</span>
dispositions so that no loss of time will result from this advance
from one covered position to another.” (Par. 369 German
I. D. R.).</p>

<p>Where large forces are concerned, the attack on a position
carefully prepared for defense will consume several days, the
assailant placing his artillery in position on the first day and
reconnoitering under cover of infantry, which is pushed to the
front.<a id="FNanchor370" href="#Footnote370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The troops of the first line are pushed forward far
enough before daylight so that they can intrench under cover
of darkness and open fire at dawn. This will be more difficult
to accomplish when covering troops or advanced positions are
located in front of the hostile position. If the assailant has
succeeded, on the previous day, in driving these troops back
upon the main position, an advance to within effective range
may be made during the night in order that the fire fight may
be opened on the succeeding day. Although the chance of
taking the enemy by surprise is eliminated in such a case, the
advantage of having diminished the distance that will have to
be crossed under fire remains.<a id="FNanchor371" href="#Footnote371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p>During the Russo-Japanese war, the effect of shrapnel, in
spite of the mediocre matériel and the lack of shields, forced
the artillery of both belligerents to seek shelter on the reverse
slope of heights. When this was neglected and when batteries
went into position in the open, within effective range, they were
quickly silenced. The fear of shrapnel caused both sides to
advance cautiously, to relinquish all close order formations at
an early moment, and to employ the spade extensively. This
alone was evidence of the fact that the artillery had accomplished
a good deal. Moreover, it was not altogether accident
that the first few of the larger Japanese night attacks occurred
coincidentally with the appearance of Russian artillery matériel,
which was superior both as regards numbers and power. The
new German I. D. R. (par. 444), in contrast with the previous
edition (II, par. 82). prescribe that the infantry attack should
not be postponed until a superiority of fire has been gained.
Thus, the regulations draw logical conclusions from the modern
armament and seek to avoid useless bombardments of hostile
positions (such, for instance, as the Russians indulged in at
Plevna and the British in South Africa).</p>

<p>“<i>The principal duty of field artillery is to support the
infantry in the most effective manner. Its duties are inseparably
connected with those of the infantry. It should, on principle,
always fight the targets that are most dangerous for its
infantry.</i>” (Par. 364 German F. A. D. R.).</p>

<p>The German Field Artillery Drill Regulations prescribe
that the guns should fire over the heads of the advancing infantry
(par. 375), and that single batteries should accompany
the infantry attack to within close range of the enemy (par.
471). When an assault is to be made, the infantry expects the
artillery to direct its fire against the point of attack until immediately
before the assault begins.</p>

<p>“But our infantry should never be obliged to dispense with
the support of artillery. The gun shields afford considerable
protection, even at the short ranges. <i>At the decisive moment
the artillery should not shrink even from the heaviest infantry
fire.</i>” (Par. 369 German F. A. D. R.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page353">[353]</span></p>

<p>“In selecting an objective, it is essential for the artillery
to consider whether, by fighting it, the infantry will be effectively
supported. Whether the hostile infantry or artillery is
chosen as an objective will depend upon the situation. As a
rule, the hostile artillery will be the proper objective for our
artillery during the preparatory stage of the action. As the
distance between the opposing infantry forces decreases, it will
become more and more necessary for the artillery to devote
itself to the hostile infantry.” (Par. 432 German F. A. D. R.).</p>

<p>If the artillery is equipped with shielded guns, it can devote
itself for some time to the most important target without
regard to the hostile artillery, contenting itself with merely
occupying the latter’s attention. (Par. 469 German F. A. D.
R.). To silence artillery in a concealed position requires curved
fire and a good deal of ammunition; but, on the other hand, artillery
so posted cannot fire upon advancing skirmishers.<a id="FNanchor373" href="#Footnote373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
Therefore, the advancing skirmishers of the assailant should
force the hostile artillery to leave its cover and to expose itself
to the attacker’s artillery. (Pars. 330 and 496 German F. A.
D. R.).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote373" href="#FNanchor373" class="label">[373]</a> This is partly due to the fact that fire cannot be adjusted quickly enough,
and that it is difficult to follow moving targets. Besides, when the targets are
small and numerous, they are difficult to hit.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The result of this procedure will be that the artillery of
both sides will engage each other’s attention with only a small
part of their guns, and concentrate the remainder on the hostile
infantry. It is obvious that the infantry will very soon demand
of its artillery in definite terms that it should first annihilate
the hostile artillery before the infantry can think of
continuing the attack.</p>

<p>The provisions of the German regulations in regard to the
fusion of activities of infantry and artillery mark an entirely
new departure. The commencement of the infantry attack
is accordingly no longer dependent upon the result of the artillery
combat; on the contrary, both combats are of equal importance
and proceed along parallel lines; the only danger is
that the infantry may make a headlong rush to the front before
a superiority of fire has been gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page354">[354]</span></p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>Confidential British instructions, dealing with the lessons learned by
the Japanese in Manchuria, contain the following: “Intrenched artillery
can be permanently silenced only under very exceptional circumstances,
as it will withdraw its personnel temporarily, as soon as the hostile fire
becomes too hot, and resume its fire again when that of the enemy abates.
The infantry attack should therefore be launched without awaiting the
result of the artillery combat, but the infantry must insist upon the artillery
completely engaging the attention of the hostile guns during the
advance. Another reason for not awaiting the outcome of the artillery
combat, lies in the great frontage of battle lines. The unsuccessful
attack made by a division will then frequently cause the neighboring unit
to make an immediate attack.”</p>

<p><b>Austria</b> (1904). “The artillery must be given an opportunity and the
necessary time for effectively preparing the infantry attack. So long as
the artillery engaged with the hostile batteries has not achieved a noticeable
success, or is not at least neutralizing the hostile artillery, the infantry
attack remains a difficult undertaking.”</p>

<p><b>France.</b> The artillery during the preparatory stage of an action:
The artillery should endeavor to silence the hostile artillery as quickly
as possible, without employing more guns than are absolutely necessary.
The commander should give the order for the attack only when the preparation
is considered sufficient.</p>

<p><b>England.</b> The regulations emphasize the necessity of pushing infantry
forward, and of supporting that infantry energetically, so as to
compel the defender to expose himself. “As soon as the hostile batteries
have been sufficiently silenced, or the infantry advances to the attack, the
fire is directed upon the point of attack in order to prepare and to cover
the assault.”</p>

<p><b>Italy.</b> The regulations state that artillery is a supporting arm for
infantry. “If the hostile artillery discloses its position from the start
by employing direct fire against the assailant’s artillery or infantry, the
attacker’s batteries endeavor to silence it or to draw its fire upon themselves,
in order to facilitate the deployment of their own infantry. If,
on the other hand, the hostile artillery remains concealed for the purpose
of saving its fire for the infantry when the latter offers a favorable target
upon arriving within effective range, then it would seem advisable for
the artillery of the assailant not to open fire at all, or to open fire only
with enough guns to cope with the available targets. The assailant’s
artillery brings the fire of all its batteries into play when the defender’s
artillery is compelled to come into action in order to support its own
infantry against the advance of the attacker’s infantry.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The difficulties of providing for coöperation between infantry
and artillery are due to the impossibility of distinguishing
at all times with certainty between friend and foe (assaulting<span class="pagenum" id="Page355">[355]</span>
guidons),<a id="FNanchor374" href="#Footnote374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> since the elimination of powder smoke and the
adoption of neutral tinted uniforms; and, further, to the circumstance
that, while we have a signal for increasing the range
of the artillery (g.g.g.), we have none for indicating that
the fire is to be concentrated upon certain points. “Uninterrupted
communication with the fighting line in front must be
provided for. For this purpose officers, who report by signal
or by telephone, should be sent forward. These officers are
primarily to ascertain how close their own firing line is to the
enemy, in order that the artillery may keep up its fire as long
as possible.” (Par. 376 German F. A. D. R.). In England,
it has been suggested to indicate the point upon which fire is to
be concentrated, by the colored ball of smoke of a special projectile.
It requires strict attention on the part of the infantry
to make its work harmonize with that of the artillery. Every
opportunity, for example, when the hostile infantry is forced
under cover by a burst of fire, should be utilized for advancing.
This is particularly emphasized in France. The defender is
to be blinded by a hailstorm of fragments. “Every rafale of
the artillery will either cause the most advanced line to make a
rush, or the troops of the rear line to come up to the firing
line in order to reinforce it or to carry it forward as much
as possible. Thus the rafale becomes a veritable shield for the
infantry (<i>véritable bouclier de l’infanterie</i>).” <span class="smcap">Langlois</span>.</p>

such weak points will only become apparent during the course

<h4>6. ENVELOPMENT.<br />
<span class="nonbold">(Pars. 392-396 German I. D. R.).</span></h4>

<p>The desire of the attacker to put a superior number of
rifles into the fight, in order to gain a superiority of fire more
quickly, naturally leads to an extension of the firing line and
to an overlapping of the defender’s line. The advantage of
overlapping the enemy’s line lies in the fact that part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page357">[357]</span>
line attacked is exposed to both frontal and oblique fire. The
effect of this oblique fire is increased by bending the wing of
the attacking line toward the enemy. If the attacking line
succeeds in pushing its firing line so far forward that not only
the hostile wing but also the hostile flank is struck, an envelopment
is brought about with the result that the lines of fire of
the assailant cross each other within the hostile position. If
the defender refuses a wing, portions of his line may be enfiladed.
This will cause such heavy losses that the defender
will begin to succumb first at the salient point of his line. A
further advantage is gained by a pressure on the enemy’s line
of retreat.</p>

<p>For carrying out the attack itself, it is immaterial whether
the commander launches it against the hostile front or a hostile
flank; individual companies, battalions, and, in large units,
regiments, finally make a frontal attack anyway. The fear
of the front of the enemy should not lead the enveloping
force to attempt to execute another enveloping movement when
it encounters a newly formed front. Surprise is, to a certain
extent, essential to the success of a flank attack.<a id="FNanchor378" href="#Footnote378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The troops
holding the enemy in front [secondary attack] must, therefore,
hold him in such a manner as to keep him in ignorance
about the true point of attack, must so engage his attention that
he will finally place the bulk of his force into the frontal action.
If this does not occur, the opponent will soon distinguish sham
from reality and will not oppose a weak, inactive containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page358">[358]</span>
force with more troops than are absolutely necessary. In this
connection, compare the conduct of the 1st Army at Königgrätz

action of the Russian IIIrd and Ist Armies at Sandepu.<a id="FNanchor379" href="#Footnote379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>
So long as the enemy is not firmly held in front, he will be able
to evade an envelopment by withdrawing. The combats of the
Boers in the Orange Free State furnish numerous examples
of this fact. The Austrian regulations have very properly

the enemy once and for all in front, while the main attack
is directed against his flank. A frontal attack made in conjunction
with a threatening demonstration against the hostile
flank frequently offers far greater prospects of success.<a id="FNanchor380" href="#Footnote380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
If a superiority is to be employed to advantage, an envelopment
must be made; all objections advanced against the “enveloping
craze” are disposed of by this statement.<a id="FNanchor381" href="#Footnote381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> “A condition
precedent to an envelopment is that the enemy be held
in front. For this purpose a determined demonstration is
most effective.” (Par. 392 German I. D. R.).</p>

and dispersion of the troops;<a id="FNanchor382" href="#Footnote382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> the possibility
that the troops fighting in front and those fighting on
the flank, separated from each other, may be defeated in detail,

<p>“The envelopment is effected in the simplest manner if
the forces designated for this task, when still at a distance
from the enemy, are given a march direction that will bring
them against the hostile flank.</p>

<p>“When initiated during the development for action or
when carried out by retained reserves, the envelopment is much
more difficult.” (Par. 393 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>In the last-mentioned case it may happen that the force
detailed to make the flank attack strikes the enemy’s front instead
of his flank. The same is true of attempts to envelop
with parts of the infantry of the first line that are already
deployed, perhaps already engaged, when the terrain is not
specially favorable for such a movement. Such movements
may, in special cases, be carried out at night. (Enveloping
movements of the divisions of the Japanese IIIrd Army at
Mukden). As a rule, this brings about only an overlapping
and flanking of the parts of the hostile position next adjacent
to the wing making the movement, but does not produce a
concentric effect on the hostile flank. Yet, even weak detachments
that reach positions from which they are able to enfilade
the enemy, facilitate the advance to the front.</p>

<p>In starting an enveloping movement when at a considerable
distance from the enemy, the force which is to make it,
is directed upon a point located in rear of the hostile position,
approximately where his reserves are presumed to be. If
then the fighting line is further extended toward the outer
flank, the assailant avoids facing the hostile front directly,
and will almost invariably have a start over the defender in extending
the threatened wing. The troops still in the act of
withdrawing from the route column naturally take charge of
the protection of the flanks.<a id="FNanchor383" href="#Footnote383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Whether the troops holding the enemy in front participate
in the assault during an enveloping movement, depends
upon circumstances. They may frequently better ensure the
success of the attack by delivering an enfilading fire than by
advancing. The commander should, at any rate, not lose
sight of this advantage. If both groups (the enveloping and
the holding group) advance to the decisive attack, they should
do so simultaneously. The group holding the enemy in front
must resist the temptation of moving to the front before the

<p>If the attacker desires to deliver an effective blow against
the enemy’s flank, <i>a considerable interval must be left between
the troops charged with the holding attack</i> [secondary attack]
<i>and those detailed to make the flank attack</i>, when the envelopment
is initiated. (Par. 393 German I. D. R.). The width of
this gap is increased to a seemingly dangerous degree by the
range of modern weapons, but real danger is not to be apprehended
as a counter-attack of the defender exposes both of
his flanks to an enveloping attack. If the enveloping group<span class="pagenum" id="Page362">[362]</span>
continues to advance, that advance in itself will very soon set a
limit to the enemy’s counter-attack. The seemingly dangerous
gap in the line, at the commencement of an action, is closed
more and more as the enemy is approached. Nevertheless, this
gap may induce a cautious leader to draw the enveloping group
closer to the frontal group, thereby impairing the effectiveness
of the envelopment. The flanking groups accomplish the best
results, but in following up tactical objectives, they should
never lose sight of the annihilation of the enemy. The difficulty
of coördinating the action of the separated parts of the line
is greater than the danger to be apprehended from a hostile
counter-attack against the frontal group. As a rule, the entry
of the enveloping group into action will be the signal for a
general attack. The effectiveness of the enveloping attack is
proportional to the energy with which it is made, but the danger
to be apprehended from a hostile counter-attack increases
in the same ratio.</p>

<h5>Provisions of Various Regulations.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>Austria.</b> When possible, the reserve is to be designated to make the
enveloping movement. (Par. 407 Austrian I. D. R.). When practicable,
a part of the reserve is employed from the start for the envelopment, and,
under certain circumstances, also for the purpose of gaining positions from
which an enfilade fire can be delivered, and for supporting the advance of
the frontal attack. The group holding the enemy in front may at first
fight a purely defensive action to prevent a hostile counter-attack, to screen
our own dispositions, and finally, by means of a fire fight at effective ranges,
to hold the hostile troops in their position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page363">[363]</span></p>

<p><b>France.</b> The envelopment is occasionally mentioned in the regulations
(for example in pars. 290, 301 and 302). The Field Service Regulations,
in discussing the attack, whose different stages may vary in length
depending upon the intentions of the commander, state, however, that the
attacker “may assail a wing or a flank of the enemy, with superior forces,
for the purpose of annihilating him.”</p>

<p><b>England.</b> The importance of flank attacks, even those in which the
defender is subdued by the flanking fire of mounted troops, is specially
mentioned, but, in this connection, it is emphasized that it is immaterial
whether the attack is finally directed against the front or a flank of the
enemy. The holding attack is to be carried out with energy in front to
prevent the enemy from drawing reinforcements to other points.</p>

<p><b>Italy.</b> While the regulations of 1891 still unqualifiedly acknowledged
that any frontal attack might succeed, the regulations of 1903 called
attention to the importance of the envelopment, without denying “that
the frontal attack might be the decisive one.” Surprise is an advantageous
factor for success, and for this reason, even covering troops, for example,
may have to be dispensed with on the march.</p>

<p>If a force desires to take the enemy by surprise, it must carefully take
advantage of the ground. The surprise may be made more complete, if
the accompanying frontal attack is energetically pushed. On the other hand,
considerations for the troops in the holding attack, set a limit to the extension
of the flanking movement. The fire power of the troops in the
holding attack must not be exhausted, or the troops themselves defeated by
a hostile counter-attack, before the moment of the general advance arrives.
They must pay the strictest attention to the course of events on the opponent’s
side; if the enemy retires, or shifts parts of his force in order
to meet a flank attack, the troops in the holding attack must act with
energy. If such signs are not apparent, a frontal advance will, as a rule,
be proper only when the pressure of the flank attack makes itself felt
on the enemy’s line. This is the only way in which “simultaneous action
by both attacks may be ensured, and this is of decisive importance to
the successful issue of the combat.”</p>

<h4>7. REMOVAL OF PACKS.</h4>

<p>It is advisable for infantry to remove packs for an attack;
such tremendous physical exertions await the troops that
everything ought to be done to reduce the load carried by the
individual man.<a id="FNanchor391" href="#Footnote391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> “As soon as it becomes doubtful whether
the troops will be able to perform the task assigned them in
action without such relief, all independent commanders, and,
in organizations larger than a regiment, commanders of regiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page364">[364]</span>
and of higher units, have authority to order the men to
remove their packs. In issuing such an order they should bear
in mind the disadvantages which may result from leaving the
packs behind. When knapsacks are removed, the ammunition
and iron rations should be taken from them. Overcoats, cooking
utensils, canteens, bread bags, and intrenching tools remain
on the men.” (Par. 301 German I. D. R.).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote391" href="#FNanchor391" class="label">[391]</a> Examples from military history in
<cite>Militär-Wochenblatt</cite>, 1902, No. 32.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>According to the French Manual of Field Engineering,
the skirmishers, especially when intrenching, may utilize the
knapsack as cover.</p>

<p>In a defeat knapsacks will frequently be lost. Thus the
Russians, after the second battle of Plevna, and Frossard’s
Corps, after the battle of Spicheren, lost their knapsacks with
camp equipment and iron rations, and, in consequence thereof,
suffered great hardships during the succeeding days. On the
other hand, during their retreat, the 43rd, 44th and 45th Infantry
Regiments of the Ist Army Corps managed to recover
without trouble the packs which they had removed before
entering the battle of Trautenau.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The infantry of the Xth Army Corps had left its knapsacks behind on
August 8th, 1870, and did not get them again until the early part of September.
The knapsacks were not hauled on wagons after the organizations,
but were left at the railroad station of St. Ingbert. On August 6th,
1870, the Würtemberg Field Brigade had left its knapsacks in a bivouac
near Reimersweiler at the risk of never seeing them again. Among other
reasons, General v. d. Tann considered it impossible for the 2nd Bavarian
Division to advance beyond Wörth, because the organizations might perhaps
thereby have been separated for several days from their baggage,
which they had left behind between Preuschdorf and Görsdorf.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>When knapsacks are removed, a detachment will have to
be left behind to guard them, otherwise they may be robbed
of their contents.<a id="FNanchor392" href="#Footnote392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> The troops always consider the trip to the
rear to get the baggage a special hardship; wagons will very
rarely be available for this purpose, as after great battles all
the wagons in the entire neighborhood will be requisitioned for
transporting the wounded, and as supply wagons will, as a rule,
not be at hand.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<h4>8. THE EMPLOYMENT OF MACHINE GUNS.</h4>

<p>In an attack upon a defensive position which is held in
force, machine gun batteries will generally be held in rear for
the time being. They form a mobile reserve in the hands of the
commander-in-chief, who may employ it for quickly reinforcing
threatened points, for exerting a pressure upon the wings
and flanks of the enemy, and for preparing the assault. Machine
gun companies, either broken up into platoons or not, as
the case may be, endeavor to reach positions from which they
can facilitate the advance of their infantry.</p>

<p>It is especially advantageous if the fire that is directed
upon the point where the hostile position is to be penetrated,
comes from a position permitting a good view, or from an
oblique direction, because the fire will not have to be discontinued
even when the infantry continues its advance or moves
to the assault. If such a position, permitting the greatest fire
effect, is reached (at about 800 m. or less from the hostile
position) any further advance of the machine guns is faulty,
because it interrupts the fire and necessitates fresh laying and
adjustment.</p>

<p>Upon the victorious termination of a fight, the machine
guns should participate in the first stages of the pursuit by
making an extended use of their fire. They hurry forward
into the captured position, as soon as it is apparent that the
victory has been gained, in order to support the infantry in
holding the position, to cover the infantry while it is re-forming,
and to reduce the last vestige of the enemy’s resistance.
If the attack fails the machine guns cover the retiring troops.</p>

<h4>9. THE CONDUCT OF THE ATTACK.</h4>

<p>In an infantry attack, the art of minor troop leading consists
of pushing a firing line, superior to the enemy, to the
strip of ground from which the power of our rifle can be
utilized to the best advantage for vanquishing the enemy; secondly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page366">[366]</span>
of bringing up supports, without exposing them to unnecessary
losses, so that they will be promptly available in
case of need. The preparations which the enemy has made for
attaining the maximum fire power (by intrenching, placing
ammunition in readiness, and by ascertaining ranges) must be
offset by employing a superior number of rifles. The commander
who brings a greater number of rifles into action
than his opponent, may count on gaining a superiority of fire
quickly and with certainty.</p>

<p>The task of higher troop leading consists of simultaneously
launching the troops against the common objective.</p>

<p>The effect of modern projectiles requires that, on open
ground, the first deployment be made when 4000-5000 m.
from the enemy. The best scheme would be to advance, without
halting, to within decisive short range of the defender, and
then to open fire, but, as previously stated, the defender should
endeavor to prevent the assailant from ever reaching these
ranges. This design of the defender must be frustrated; if
artillery is unable to accomplish this, machine guns or a part of
the infantry must enter the fight; but all parts of the force not
required for this fire fight at medium ranges should continue
their movement without interruption.</p>

<p>The most difficult task that infantry may be called upon
to perform consists of advancing over an open plain, in the
face of unsubdued artillery, when the situation does not permit
night or the effect of an envelopment to be awaited.</p>

<p>The first deployment as skirmishers is made for the purpose
of protecting the advancing troops against surprise. Frequently,
a squad or a section per company will suffice for this
purpose, but these units should cover the entire front available
for the organization to which they belong. A uniform and
simultaneous advance along the whole line is impossible however,
on account of the diversity of the ground at various
points. When cover is available, skirmish lines may be formed
quickly and pushed forward as entities, but when cover is lacking,
firing lines may have to be deployed slowly and piecemeal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page367">[367]</span>
The unit that has pushed farthest to the front must facilitate
with its fire the advance of those who have encountered greater
obstacles in advancing.</p>

<p>Long, dense firing lines and the supports following them
are exposed to such heavy losses in open country, even at long
ranges, that their advance will soon hesitate. Moreover, the
defender will only fire on targets whose size and density promise
a great number of hits. Therefore, the assailant should endeavor
to lead his infantry forward in loose, disconnected
skirmish lines, which are difficult for the enemy to hit. As a
rule, the assailant should not open fire until after he has been
reinforced and has sufficient fire power available. (Par. 334
German I. D. R.). The situation in which these thin firing
lines are placed is by no means a favorable one, as the defender
will concentrate his fire on the points where the assailant
seems to be filling up his line “for the purpose of overwhelming
the defender permanently by a superiority of fire.” (Par. 413
German I. D. R.). The skirmishers will then quite naturally
open fire for the purpose of interfering with the cool delivery
of the defender’s fire.</p>

<p>Such a piecemeal, almost independent advance, during
which the effect of the accustomed word of command is considerably
reduced and control and supervision of the individual
skirmisher is impossible, presupposes that the troops are well-drilled,
individually trained, and, above all, intelligent. Attention
must also be called to the fact that the firing line can
offer but a weak resistance to an enemy advancing unexpectedly
in force. But, in spite of these drawbacks, this mode of advance
has its advantages for crossing a plain devoid of cover.
It permits favorable fire positions to be reached with greater
safety, especially if these positions can be picked out with the
aid of field glasses, than would be the case if dense skirmish
lines were led forward simultaneously.</p>

<p>The advance of the infantry under hostile fire, over open
ground, may accordingly be <span class="nowrap">conducted&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page368">[368]</span></p>

<p>1. At a walk, by long rushes made by strong units (by
platoons at least), supported by powerful artillery fire or by
the fire of a machine gun battery or a detachment of skirmishers
posted in a favorable position;</p>

<p>2. By shorter rushes made by smaller units (“proper
only when conditions demand it”);</p>

<p>3. By crawling, or, in exceptional cases (for example in
passing through fields of standing grain), by employing</p>

<p>4. Fire while in motion.</p>

<p>The fire fight at long ranges and near the extreme limit
of mid ranges is only a means for the purpose of reaching
the decisive battle ranges, and of interfering with the undisturbed
delivery of the enemy’s fire. Fire must be opened at
as late a moment as possible. Our firing line should in any
case be strong enough, upon entering the zone of mid ranges,
to reply effectively to the enemy’s fire. Experience has shown
that an assailant who opens fire at “long” ranges rarely reaches
short ranges. (See <a href="#Page149">p. 149</a> supra).</p>

<p>The distances at which the echelons in rear follow the
firing line should be less (as laid down in the Italian and Russian
regulations) than the distance which separates the firing
line of the attacker from that of the defender. The distances
may be increased without danger at this stage of the combat,
as the decision is not imminent, but on the flanks the supports
will have to be brought up closer in order that an unexpected
flank attack may be effectively opposed. All parts of the attacking
force move&mdash;as long as possible at a walk&mdash;straight to
the front. Subordinate leaders, taking advantage of all available
cover, should endeavor to lead the supports skillfully after
the firing line. This requires that the ground to be crossed
be reconnoitered. As a rule, a movement by the flank upon
leaving cover is costlier than an advance by squads or sections
over open ground. Long lines make it easier for the hostile
artillery to adjust and observe its fire, while, when a greater
number of targets of smaller frontage is exposed, this is made
more difficult. For this reason, supports are not led forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page369">[369]</span>
as entire units, but, on the contrary, they are broken up, and,
under certain circumstances, even disintegrated into smaller
units. The units following in rear remain as long as possible
in close order formations, preferably in route columns. “Man
is by nature exceedingly timid. Soldiers, even those drawn
from the educated classes, who were fully aware of the supreme
importance of gaining the victory, broke down on coming under
fire. In close order the moral encouragement due to the proximity
of superiors and comrades kept up their courage.” (Hessert).<a id="FNanchor393" href="#Footnote393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
Where cover is lacking, the supports will also have to
be deployed. Large units are broken up into platoons, which
deploy and follow each other at considerable distances.<a id="FNanchor394" href="#Footnote394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the enemy opens fire, platoon commanders
must decide whether or not it ought to be returned; but the
closer one can get to the enemy without firing a shot, the
better. According to the German F. S. R. (par. 296), a prolonged,
uninterrupted forward movement of skirmish lines
in the open, at less than 1000 m. from the enemy, is possible
only when supported by adequate fire. On the other hand,
even skirmishers lying down suffer serious losses when 600 m.
from the enemy.</p>

<p>Thus, at mid ranges, begins the actual, protracted fire fight,
which, in the first place, is to make a further advance possible,
and which, subsequently, is to produce a superiority of
fire. As taught by experience, this cannot be accomplished
from a single position, if the enemy is efficient.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>A so-called “main firing position”, which was to be located 400-600
m. from the enemy, was frequently used during peace maneuvers for the
purpose of bringing cohesion and harmony into the attack. In making
use of such a position, the principal difficulty of every serious infantry
attack, that of crossing the space lying between the first firing position
and the assaulting position, was not appreciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page370">[370]</span></p>

<p><b>Austria.</b> (Par. 589 I. D. R.). “When conditions are very favorable,
it might be possible to choose the firing position in which the decisive fire
fight is to be begun, so close to the enemy that the decision can be gained
from it.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The fire fight must be taken up by enough troops to make
it impossible for the defender, who holds his position strongly,
to gain a superiority of fire over some parts of the attacking
force. The supports will now move closer to the firing line,
in order to fill every gap in that line and to meet every attempt
of the defender to gain the upper hand. The echelons of the
second line which have not as yet been absorbed by the firing
line, move up in a similar manner. If the hostile fire abates,
parts of the firing line should endeavor to get closer to the
enemy; they are followed by the next adjoining units. At this
stage of the action the attacker will have to give up, to some
extent, his distribution in depth.</p>

<p>Superiority of fire is an essential condition to victory. It
is attained by better marksmanship, fire control and fire direction,
by taking advantage of cover, and by concentrating a powerful
fire against the decisive point. When the attacker’s troops
are not well trained, a greater number of rifles and more ammunition
will be required to gain this superiority. Accordingly,
the attacker will either make an envelopment or employ fire of
position. The attacker possesses a great advantage, in that
he does not need to gain a superiority of fire along the whole
front, but only at a single point. It suffices for him to contain
weak portions of the hostile front with suitable, well concealed
combat groups capable of quickly developing a powerful
fire, while he masses the bulk of his forces against the decisive
point. The defender, who never knows where the decisive blow
is going to fall, ought not to allow himself to be enticed into
occupying portions of his line more weakly than the rest.</p>

<p>The attainment of the superiority of fire requires time,
and, in addition, coolness and patience on the part of the leaders.
All the ammunition that is expended in gaining this superiority
is later compensated for by fewer losses. The heavy losses<span class="pagenum" id="Page371">[371]</span>
sustained by the Prussian troops on the slopes of Point du
Jour, on August 18th, 1870, may be traced directly to the fact
that the leaders did not know how to wait.</p>

<p>Superiority of fire<a id="FNanchor395" href="#Footnote395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> is absolutely essential to the success
of the attack. Any failure to appreciate this principle will lead
to such heavy losses that even if the assailant were to reach
the enemy’s position, he would be too weak to gain the victory.<a id="FNanchor396" href="#Footnote396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

shot at the very beginning of the engagement, all attempts to carry orders or
ammunition to the firing line were abandoned. No attempts were made to
relieve the pressure by means of the fire of sharpshooters, by bringing up reinforcements,
or by gaining ground by crawling.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote396" href="#FNanchor396" class="label">[396]</a> “Battles are won by the superiority of fire.” <span class="smcap">Frederick the Great</span> in
his <cite>Military Testament</cite>, 1768.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>During the fluctuating fire fight, which lasts for hours,
the attacker will have succeeded in working forward little by
little until he is close to the enemy’s position. His superiority
will now make itself felt; the fire from the part of the hostile
line that is to be penetrated will begin to abate; and, at first,
single groups, then several, and finally, whole units of the
enemy’s line will commence to crumble away. The attacker
should wait until this effect is produced before he begins the
assault; if he does not do this, the attack is sure to fail.</p>

<p><i>Austria.</i> (Par. 590 I. D. R.). “The close approach of
a long firing line to an enemy who occupies a good position,
may well pass as a proof of the assailant’s superiority. Nevertheless,
this does not, under all circumstances, furnish assurance
that a forward movement for the purpose of penetrating
the hostile position will now succeed; a premature
assault may still result in disaster. <i>As long as the conduct of
the opponent does not show clear indications that his fire power
is crippled, nothing remains for the attacker but to continue
the fight for the superiority of fire.</i>”</p>

<p>Even in this, mistakes are not precluded. It is far from
easy to recognize when the defender of a position has been
sufficiently subdued by fire to make an assault feasible, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page372">[372]</span>
when the proper moment has arrived for launching the reserves.
It is only necessary to recall the premature advance
of the artillery and cavalry over the ravine of the Mance
brook, on August 18th, 1870.</p>

<p>The cessation of the defender’s fire, in itself, is not a sure
sign that his firing line is shaken, as the attacker is unable to
distinguish between a fire pause ordered by the commander
on the defensive and the forced discontinuance of the fight.
Sure indications are not available until men actually leave the
defender’s fighting line here and there, and attempts of the
leaders to hold the wavering ones are clearly apparent.</p>

<p>At this moment, a leader who has resolved to assault,
should order bayonets fixed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The temporary interruption of the fire occasioned by
fixing bayonets is of no importance, as the superiority of fire
has already been gained. If bayonets are prematurely ordered
to be fixed, the accuracy of the fire will soon be impaired, as
the firing of rifles, weighted down by the attached bayonets,
increases the fatigue of the men. When the troops are excited,
the downward deflection of the bullets caused by
fixing the bayonet can, however, only produce a good effect.
It is best to fix bayonets at the signal “Fix bayonet”. In the
excitement prevailing at the moment, it will be impossible to
execute the order with any uniformity, but it is a good plan,
in time of peace, to require one man of each file to fire while
the other one fixes his bayonet. The approaching reserves
fix bayonets while on the march.</p>

<h4>10. THE ASSAULT.</h4>

<p>“The assault does not, strictly speaking, belong to the
domain of tactics. Rules, showing in what formations and
under what conditions the assault should be made in war, cannot
be formulated. At any rate, fire tactics are not only an
essential factor but also the crowning act of combat; the
assault is nothing but the postlude. All modern combats
show that the morale of the men suffers most, and that, in
consequence thereof, troops deteriorate quickly when they are
exposed to the annihilating effect of fire. This lesson was
thoroughly learned by the Austrians in 1866, and by the Russians
in front of Plevna. Of what avail were ‘self-sacrifice’,
the ‘unconquerable determination to gain the victory’, the
‘desire for hand to hand conflict’, and all the other terms
that are employed to prove that the moral factors are the
decisive ones in war? That they are the decisive factors
needs no proof whatever; it follows, as a matter of course,
from uniform training, uniform leadership, and uniform arms.
But tactics fit for use in war, are to furnish, above all else,
ways and means, showing how and by what methods the
fighting energy of troops may be preserved most effectively,
and thus contribute directly toward preventing the premature
deterioration of the morale of the troops.”<a id="FNanchor397" href="#Footnote397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“The defeat of the opponent is consummated by the assault
with fixed bayonets.” (Par. 324 German I. D. R.). A
premature advance to the assault, with all the peculiar features
attending it, produces an aversion against the attack, an undue
extension of battle lines, and makes it impossible for reinforcements
to come up, except under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>The decision for making the assault emanates either
from the subordinate leaders in the firing line or from the
commander of the whole force. The latter may give the impulse<span class="pagenum" id="Page374">[374]</span>
for the assault by launching the reserve. This is undoubtedly
the safer procedure. “When the decision to assault
emanates from the commanders in rear, notice thereof is
given by sounding the signal ‘fix bayonet’, which must be repeated
by all the units that are to take part in the assault. At
this signal the skirmishers increase their fire to the utmost.
The parts of the firing line which are still in rear, move
forward, as quickly as possible, to a position close to the
enemy. All reinforcements in rear hasten straight to the
front. As soon as the leading line is to form for the assault,
all the trumpeters sound the signal ‘forward, double time’, all
the drummers beat their drums, and all parts of the force throw
themselves with the greatest determination upon the enemy.
It should be a point of honor with skirmishers not to allow
the supports to overtake them earlier than the moment of penetrating
the enemy’s position. When immediately in front of
the enemy, the men should charge bayonet and, with a cheer,
penetrate the position.” (Pars. 346-348 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>It is very difficult for a superior commander to perceive
when the proper moment for making the assault has arrived,
as he is compelled to remain so far in rear of the fighting
line, especially where large forces are concerned, that he can
only follow the general course of the attack. The first indication
which he receives as to whether the enemy’s fire power
has been broken all along the line, is the advance of his own
firing line. He will still more rarely be able to see in time
when the resistance of the enemy abates at some one point,
and it will be quite impossible for him to issue orders with
sufficient promptness to turn such an advantage quickly to
good account.<a id="FNanchor398" href="#Footnote398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>The firing line will, therefore, frequently have to take
the initiative in bringing about the assault. It is absolutely necessary,
especially if the enemy evacuates the position, that
the firing line, quickly taking advantage of this moment, pass
over to the bayonet attack. If the firing line were to wait
until the reserves are up, valuable time would be lost, under
certain circumstances; the enemy might recover from his
temporary bewilderment and re-form, or might even receive
reinforcements. In addition, hesitation on the part of the
attacker would enable the enemy to gain time, evacuate the
position unmolested, retire in good order, and perhaps take up
a new position, or at least evade quickly the pursuing fire of the
assailant. The firing line would be the first, in such a case, to
perceive when and where the resistance of the enemy abates;
it should therefore make the most of this knowledge and throw
itself upon the part of the defender’s force that is in the act
of withdrawing.</p>

<p>When the impulse for the assault emanates from the firing
line, there is danger that instead of a general attack only a
local one will result. It is impossible to conceive that the
whole firing line will simultaneously consider that the moment
for the assault has arrived; in general, only a part of that
line at a time will come to this conclusion. Such local attacks
are hazardous, however, and have some chance of succeeding
only in covered terrain. A local assault made by a single
battalion or company will usually attract the fire of a considerable
portion of the hostile line and quite naturally dash
itself to pieces against it. Even assuming that a gallantly
charging unit succeeds in unexpectedly penetrating the hostile
line at some one point, the defender will at once attack it in
vastly superior force and compel it to retire with heavy loss.
Furthermore, the failure is usually not confined to the one
unit. The troops on the right and left of it, although they
are perhaps farther from the enemy, and have not yet shaken
him sufficiently by their fire, nevertheless join in the assault,
as soon as they see the first unit rush forward. As a rule,<span class="pagenum" id="Page376">[376]</span>
when the decision to assault emanates from the firing line,
a series of unsuccessful assaults will result. These will,
however, bring good troops closer and closer to the enemy,
until the great moment of definitely gained superiority finally
arrives.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The General Staff account of the Franco-German war<a id="FNanchor399" href="#Footnote399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> very aptly
describes the decisive moment for the assault: “The tension of the
tactical situation was increased to the highest pitch by the prolonged fight
at close range; the time was now ripe for the decision and the German
corps commanders issued orders for the assault. Before this order reached
the leading line, however, the German general officers on the spot had
decided, at about 7:30 P. M., to undertake the assault on their own responsibility,
as they considered the attack sufficiently prepared. On the
signal given by them, and in many instances of their own accord, the
Prussian and Saxon battalions hurled themselves, just as the sun was setting,
on the position which had been so long and so tenaciously defended
by the enemy.” (<b>St. Privat</b>). Consult, <cite>Der 18. August</cite>, pp. 525 and 571.</p>

available.”&mdash;“General von Bose now ordered a general attack. At the

<div class="longquote">

<p>The assault was thus not a result of the superiority that had been
gained, but an act of desperation in a situation that had become unbearable.
Moreover, the success of the assault was not due to any numerical
superiority of the attacker, but to the lack of initiative of the defender,
and to the fact that he confined himself to purely defensive action.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>It is, therefore, after all, an open question whether the
initiative of parts of the line should govern the conduct of the
entire force. In some instances, it certainly ought not to govern,
if disaster is to be avoided. When a portion of the firing
line advances, however, and the tactical situation in any way
permits, neighboring units should at once conform to the
movement. The units in rear, in particular, should, in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page377">[377]</span>
case, promptly hurry forward by the shortest route without
regard to losses, support the firing line, and prevent it being
repulsed. (Par. 345, German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>This brings up the question, as to whether the trumpeters
of the assaulting units should sound the signal “fix bayonet,”
in this assault, and thus bring about a prompt general assault
by the entire line. This might obviously cause the troops to
advance prematurely to the assault, a danger which might be
brought about by the junior platoon commander. No one but
the supreme commander, therefore, has the right to order this
signal to be sounded when he wishes a general assault to be
made. This is prescribed in the German Infantry Drill Regulations
(par. 347). If the commander of the firing line decides
to assault, he transmits his decision to the rear by means of
signals (s. s. s.). The supreme commander can still restrain
the skirmishers by the signal h. h. h., or bring about a general
assault all along the line by giving the signal “fix bayonet”.
If a unit moves to the assault contrary to the wishes of the
supreme commander, he should possess enough nerve to look
on calmly while it is being defeated. It is much better for
him to allow a single unit to be defeated than to cause the
failure of the general attack by a premature advance.</p>

<p>“Although the assault should be made as nearly simultaneously
as possible, this is not to be understood as meaning
that all the units should penetrate the hostile position at one
and the same time. Such simultaneous action is immaterial,
and might, indeed, cause parts of the line who had a chance
of successfully carrying out the assault, to hesitate because
others are still in rear. The power of the attack would accordingly
be impaired. All units that have once started must
continue to advance uninterruptedly.” (Par. 349 German
I. D. R.).</p>

<p>It depends upon the situation whether the troops intended
for the holding attack finally participate in the assault itself.
If they can bring an effective fire to bear upon the point of<span class="pagenum" id="Page378">[378]</span>
attack from an oblique direction and thereby ensure the success
of the attack, they should make the most of this advantage.
(Par. 340 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>When the enemy advances to the frontal counter-attack,
as laid down in the Russian and British regulations, the skirmishers
throw themselves down for the purpose of firing. The
supports in the act of moving up continue their march. If the
enemy faces about, all the troops press after him.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The French regulations (par. 270) also consider such a counter-attack:</p>

<p>“If the attacker presses forward too hastily and if he threatens to carry
the defender’s position, fresh troops, which have been assembled in a place
sheltered from view, attack him energetically, while the troops already
engaged increase the intensity of their fire. This powerful and energetic
counter-attack produces confusion in the enemy’s ranks and compels him to
retire, or at least to discontinue his forward movement until he has had
time to recover.... The troops in the counter-attack should move forward
without hesitation and regardless of the cost. When such a forward movement
has to be discontinued, the commander must decide where it shall
cease. The efforts of all should be directed toward one object, that of tiring
and demoralizing the enemy by constant counter-attacks, until the moment
arrives when the commander must order the offensive to be assumed.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The German Infantry Drill Regulations contain no further
rules for the conduct of the assault. If the physical and
moral power of the enemy is so broken by the preceding fire
fight that he commences to evacuate his position, it is quite immaterial
what sort of an assault is made; the men simply fire
and rush quickly after the retiring enemy. In this case the
assault is nothing but a postlude of the fire fight.</p>

<p>A brave and well disciplined opponent who is energetically
led, will not allow himself to be forced to evacuate his
position by fire alone; to compel him to evacuate his position
will at the very least require that an assault be threatened.</p>

<p>Before the Boer war, the British held the view that the
effect of the fire fight alone was so great that the assault would
strike nothing but an evacuated or, at most, a feebly defended
position. The assault was to commence after the enemy had<span class="pagenum" id="Page379">[379]</span>
ceased firing and had sought protection in his trenches. The
following statement is made by one who fought on the Boer
side:</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>“The artillery supported the advance until the latter had arrived within
300 or 400 m. of the enemy; then it ceased firing. After a brief period
of preparation by fire, the British infantry began the assault simultaneously
in one long line. This assault, made without fire support, was repulsed
without trouble by the Boer fire. On several occasions, short lines
of our opponent had begun to advance, but these were in every instance
forced to throw themselves down after a few moments had elapsed. Thereupon
the whole British line, in my estimation at least 300-400 men strong,
began to advance. One could clearly hear the British leaders call to their
men to cease firing, could clearly hear the command ‘fix bayonet’, and the
cheer ‘God save the Queen’! run along the British line. Then the
whole hostile line rose. As they rushed toward us, they looked to me
like a grayish yellow swarm, the men being almost shoulder to shoulder
and the line being in places three to four men deep, just as frequently
happens in charges made during our own peace maneuvers. At the same
moment, we began firing. Our fire was at first somewhat wild, but was soon
better controlled by our more experienced fighters calling, ‘Steady boys,
steady, then none of them will reach us’. More and more men fell in
the British line, and, when it had arrived within 100 or 80 paces of our
position, its energy had spent itself. A part of the men threw themselves
down behind boulders and fired, while the majority rushed back to the
shelter of some bushes; but even there it was for the most part impossible
to hold them. An assaulting enemy who does not fire, is not dangerous,
even if he is numerically superior. In this case, the defender can fire
a number of times, and the closer the assailant is to the defender’s position
the more quickly and certainly will his force dwindle away. No one
will, however, be able to induce the same men to advance again under
hostile fire over an open field, that is, to expose themselves without shelter
to the hostile fire.”<a id="FNanchor401" href="#Footnote401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that fire support is essential to the success of
such an assault. This should be furnished in the first place
by the artillery. In furnishing this support, artillery can employ
time fire only until the infantry arrives within 300 m. of
the enemy, while percussion fire may be continued until the
infantry arrives within 150 m. of the enemy. During the<span class="pagenum" id="Page380">[380]</span>
attack on Pieters Hill (1900), Colonel Kitchener is said to
have told his artillerymen that he would not censure them if
two or three of their shrapnel burst in the ranks of his infantry.
The following statement appears in a British memorial on the
lessons of the war in the Far East: “The moral effect produced
by artillery fire, which forced the defenders to take to
cover and did not even permit them to raise their heads above
the parapet, was so highly esteemed by the Japanese infantry
that it requested the batteries to continue firing, without regard
to the losses thereby inflicted in its own ranks, until it
had taken the position or unfurled small national flags as an
indication that fire support was no longer necessary. According
to the opinion of the Japanese themselves, the losses inflicted
in their infantry by their own guns were insignificant
in comparison to the losses which the defender could inflict
by delivering his fire undisturbed at a range of a few hundred
meters, when not kept down by the attacking artillery.” According
to the Austrian regulations, one unit is to remain
halted for the purpose of directing its fire upon the point of
attack or upon any reserves that might appear. This provision
involves a grave danger, in that it may induce the leader to
retain a considerable number of troops in rallying positions,
instead of launching his whole force in the assault.</p>

<p>When fire support is deemed necessary in an attack, the
artillery will perhaps be best able to furnish it until the infantry
has reached a certain point. Then a moment will arrive, however,
when the guns will have to cease firing, and when even
the infantry units which have been left behind to support the
attack, will no longer be able to direct their fire upon the enemy
on account of the wide frontage of the assaulting force. The
defender’s troops would have to be poor indeed, if they would
not at this moment, when the assailant’s fire has practically
ceased, raise their heads above the parapet for the purpose of
emptying their magazines once more at the assailant, even
though the fire be unaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page381">[381]</span></p>

<p>If the assault is to succeed, it is essential however, that,
while the attacker covers the last 100-150 m., the defender be
compelled to keep under cover. <i>This can only be accomplished
by employing fire while in motion.</i></p>

<p>This fire is practicable because the defender, who has
been overwhelmed in the fire fight, has sought shelter in his
works; it is advantageous, as it is only to compel the enemy
to keep under cover. It would unquestionably be a mistake,
and not justifiable in any case, to employ fire while in motion,
when these conditions are not fulfilled, when the enemy is not
completely subdued and is perhaps waiting under cover, ready
to meet the assailant’s assault. Supporting the infantry assault
with fire has, moreover, the additional advantage of preventing
the defender from bringing up his reserves.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The following is taken from a private letter of Sir Ian Hamilton,
perhaps the foremost British infantry tactician, who had the good fortune,
at Elandslaagte and Doornkop, of leading his command close up to the
enemy: “It is my opinion that no matter what regulations are promulgated
in time of peace, the men will fire during the assault. You may
rest assured that nothing will prevent their doing this. One would do
well, therefore, to reckon with this factor from the very start. The greatest
danger is always that the men will throw themselves down instead
of continuing the advance. And, if the men have once thrown themselves
down during the assault, they will rise only for the purpose of retreating.”<a id="FNanchor402" href="#Footnote402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote402" href="#FNanchor402" class="label">[402]</a> In
<cite>Ausbildung der Infanterie für den Angriff</cite>, p. 63, Colonel <span class="smcap">von der Goltz</span>
makes the following statement in regard to an experiment: “As the line
gradually drew closer to the defender’s position, the desire of the individual
men to get into the hostile position as quickly as possible, became more and
more apparent; the prone position for firing was abandoned for the kneeling
position, finally for the standing position, and, quite naturally, fire while in
motion resulted in the end. Fire while in motion is authorized by the regulations
and is, in this case, certainly permissible. Its employment in this case
may be traced to the very proper desire of not allowing the enemy, who has
been held down this long, to raise himself above his parapet. This fire while
in motion should not be confused with the fire while in motion formerly
employed by long skirmish lines at long ranges, and condemned at that time.
The latter had for its object not the keeping down of an enemy already overwhelmed,
but, on the contrary, was intended to overpower an unshaken opponent.”</p>

The question as to how often the advance to hand to hand conflict is carried
out, may be left open. As a rule, it is employed only when it may be presumed
that the enemy will not await the onslaught.” In his memoranda of 1865, in
regard to the influence of improved fire arms on tactics, he states: “If the
bayonet fights, so often mentioned in French accounts of the campaign of 1859,
were stripped of their dramatic splendor, and if the simple prosaic truth could
be ascertained, by far the greater number of these reports would be corrected in
so far as to state that the opponent, shaken by more or less heavy losses, avoided
the actual collision.”</p>

<p>If the assault is not made at this moment, the crisis may
pass, but a determined rush by the attacker will, as a rule,
bring about the decision. The threat of a bayonet attack usually
decides those who have remained in the position, to make
no further resistance. The attacker must make use of the
moral factors in an assault, hence the importance of running,
cheering, and accompanying the advance of all bodies in close

<p>In time of peace there should be instilled in the soldier the
conviction that, with the bayonet, he is a match for any opponent;
that, in bayonet fighting, no other infantry is the equal
of his own. The soldier should not be taught to shrink from
the bayonet attack, but to seek it. If the infantry is deprived
of the <i>arme blanche</i>, if the impossibility of bayonet fighting is
preached, and the soldier is never given an opportunity in time
of peace of defending himself, man to man, with his weapon
in bayonet fencing, an infantry will be developed, which is
unsuitable for attack and which, moreover, lacks a most essential
quality, viz., the moral power to reach the enemy’s position.</p>

<p>“The rarity of bayonet fights does not prove the uselessness
of the bayonet, but shows that opponents will rarely be
found who are equally capable of making use of it. Indeed,
the bayonet cannot be abolished for the reason, if for no other,
that it is the sole and exclusive embodiment of that will power
which alone, both in war and in every-day life, attains its<span class="pagenum" id="Page384">[384]</span>
object, whereas reason only tends to facilitate the attainment
of the object.</p>

<p>“Let us assume that there exists an army which bases
success in battle on fire action, and takes for granted that the
enemy will not be able to get near enough to make a bayonet
attack. If this army were to encounter another army which,
without undervaluing the effect of fire, remembers the bayonet
at the proper time, it would be filled with the most dreadful
dismay when the enemy actually assails it with the bayonet.
With modern rifles, bullets are unquestionably a good substitute
for the bayonet at close quarters, but this is true only of troops
who do not fear annihilation, <i>i.e.</i>, troops trained to use the
bayonet and capable of closing with the enemy after firing.
If this is not the case, such firing at close quarters is a pure
waste of ammunition, since men who are afraid to close with
the enemy, if necessary at such a moment, will usually fire into
the air.</p>

<p>“If the soldier has been taught, however, to annihilate the
enemy from a distance and from behind cover, he will naturally
prefer this mode of inflicting losses, since he runs very
little risk of getting hurt, and will, moreover, acquire an
aversion for exposing himself to danger, <i>i.e.</i>, he will shrink
from bayonet work. Hence, if we attach too much importance
to marksmanship, we produce a more or less trained soldier,
who may possibly be a very good shot at long ranges, but who
is not especially inclined to take his chances in a bayonet fight.
Incidentally, target practice develops the mentality of the man,
but does not improve his morale.” <span class="smcap">Dragomirov</span>.</p>

<p><b>If the attacker succeeds in carrying the position</b>, he
will be at a disadvantage for the moment; his troops will be
in confusion and exhausted, and a large number of officers
will be gone. If the defender, reinforced by fresh reserves,
takes advantage of this moment, he may be able to turn the
tide of the battle. The inclination of the men to pursue the
enemy with the bayonet, instead of halting and making the
most of the fire power of their rifles, is noticeable in all battles.
The attacker will have to take steps to restrain his victorious
infantry, and, as soon as opportunity offers, to pursue the
enemy with fire. Under cover of this fire fresh troops or
quickly assembled detachments should advance on the flanks
in pursuit of the enemy. There is a wide difference between
a wild, headlong rush after the enemy and a systematic pursuit.
Infantry that rushes headlong to the front after penetrating
a position must be brought back at any cost, unless it
can enter a second position simultaneously with the enemy.<a id="FNanchor411" href="#Footnote411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>In addition to pursuing the enemy with fire, the attacker
should re-form his troops without regard to their original
arrangement (if the enemy gives him time enough, the original
organizations should be re-formed), occupy the position, replenish
ammunition, and remove the prisoners. It is a mistake to
mass more rifles in the captured position than can be employed
to advantage, as the enemy will in all probability direct a heavy
fire upon it. As soon as the fight has been decided, the echelons
in rear should be halted, so that they can be employed as
occasion demands. The leaders of these units will often have
to act independently in such a case. (Par. 350 German
I. D. R.). Preparations should be made to the end that
hostile counter-attacks may be at once repulsed. These rules
are particularly important when the position that has been
carried is not the main position but only an advanced post.<a id="FNanchor412" href="#Footnote412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>
These measures must be taken independently by all leaders
who participated in the assault, without waiting for orders from
superior authority. The pursuit should be begun as soon as
possible with formed bodies of troops (if practicable, while
the enemy is being pursued by fire), in order to interfere with
his re-forming, to prevent his taking up route column, and to
overrun his rallying positions. The battle of Beaumont consisted
of a whole series of such pursuing actions. The arrival
of night should by no means be used as an excuse for discontinuing
the pursuit, for night above all else is the mightiest ally
of a bold victor.<a id="FNanchor413" href="#Footnote413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

these men while they are exposed to the most effective fire of
the enemy. Only when the nearest cover is reached can there
be any question of halting. (Par. 327 German I. D. R.). When
cover is not available near at hand, the exhaustion of the troops
will soon stop the flight, or the leaders may be able to face them
again to the front, as soon as the hostile fire abates. However,
the retreating troops will have placed quite a distance between
themselves and the enemy before this can be done, and the
latter, unmolested by fire from the attacker, will be able to
take full advantage of the technical qualities of his rifle, unless
the attacker’s artillery or cavalry prevent his doing so. No
matter where the retreating troops come to a halt and face
to the front, there they must stay, and, if the hostile fire permits,
intrench.</p>

<p>As a result of the lessons gained in the Russo-Turkish
war, general instructions were issued to the Russian infantry
on the subject of intrenching in attack. According to these
instructions, the spade was to be used in attack in the following
cases: In fortifying a captured position, as a protection
against a possible offensive return of the defender; in holding
supporting points necessary to a continuation of the attack;
and in placing rallying positions in a state of defense. The
order directing troops to intrench was to be given, in all cases,
by the supreme commander. The following procedure was to
be observed: “Every man equipped with a spade and who is
not sheltered by some feature of the terrain, places his rifle on
the ground and, lying on his left side, begins to excavate a hole
parallel to his body. This hole should be as long as the distance
from his left elbow to his knee, as wide as the length of the
spade-handle, and as deep as the width of the blade of the
spade. The excavated earth and sod he places in front of his
head, which he endeavors to protect as quickly as possible.
When this work is completed, he rolls over into the excavated
hole, and, lying on his right side, repeats the operation. When
he has obtained sufficient cover, he hands his spade to the other
man of the file, who proceeds in a similar fashion.”</p>

<p>The Japanese, on account of their numerical inferiority,<span class="pagenum" id="Page390">[390]</span>
found it necessary to get along with few supports and reserves,
and therefore made use of the spade in terrain devoid of cover,
or utilized sand bags,<a id="FNanchor420" href="#Footnote420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> which were carried along. In this
manner, they laboriously worked their way to within assaulting
distance of the enemy. In many instances, this necessitated
whole days of fighting when an envelopment was impossible.
Sand bags were an advantage when the ground was frozen or
when the sod was not thick.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote420" href="#FNanchor420" class="label">[420]</a>
See <a href="#Page344">p. 344</a> supra. Frequently the bags, which could be tied with a string,
were filled near the place where they were to be used. The advance was considerably
retarded by carrying along sand bags. During the attack on Yuputz,
on March 1st, 1905, by the 8th Infantry Division of the IInd Army, the first
sand bag cover was constructed 700 m. and the last 250 m. from the village.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p><i>Results of Russian experiments.</i> The sand bag employed was made
of coarse linen of grayish green color and when filled and tied, was approximately
50 cm. long (width of a man’s shoulders), 30-35 cm. wide, and
30-35 cm. high. The filled sand bag weighed 14-20 kg., depending upon
the filling material (sand or broken stone). When filled with sand or
broken stone, the sand bag stopped all projectiles, while, when filled with
earth, even two bags placed in rear of each other did not afford sufficient
protection. The sand bags were scarcely discernible with the naked eye
at 400 m. They were not an easy target to hit, and, even at 300 m., it
was difficult to aim at them.</p>

<p>The men had a distinct aversion against constructing shelter trenches
while lying down. During the war they could be made to intrench only
by great exertions on the part of the officers. The reason for this is obvious;
digging with the small spade while in a prone position is uncomfortable.
The skirmisher considers it much more profitable to fire than
to puzzle out how he can best stir up the soil with the small spade while
in a prone position. Moreover, he knows that at any moment he may have
to make a rush to the front.</p>

<p>The beautiful idea that these trenches were to be used and widened
by the reserves, was usually not carried out. The reserves preferred to
make longer rushes and to take advantage of folds of the ground rather
than occupy themselves with intrenching under hostile fire.</p>

<p>At ranges from 2000-1000 m., single men made short rushes, only 30-40
m. long, as the filled sand bag constituted a considerable load. Before
a man ran forward, he slung his rifle, grasped the sand bag with one
hand at the tied end, with the other at a loop specially provided for that
purpose; then he jumped up, ran forward 30-40 m., as rapidly as he
could in a crouching position, placed the sand bag on the ground, and
threw himself down behind it. Under effective hostile fire, at 1000-550
m. (during our peace maneuvers at 420-280 m.), the men then crawl<span class="pagenum" id="Page391">[391]</span>
forward, utilizing the sand bag as cover. The men would rather crawl
a greater distance with the sand bag than intrench while lying down.</p>

<p>From the position of the enemy, the skirmishers lying behind grayish
green sand bags could not be recognized with the naked eye at 2000-1000
m. It is reported that both officers and men were at first very much
disinclined toward making these experiments, but that they changed their
views after one or two exercises, and the principal apprehension, that of
increasing the weight of the field equipment, disappeared because of the
undeniable advantages of the sand bag.</p>

<p>Such cover constructed by the assailant has no greater
value than natural cover found on the ground over which the
attack is made; it affords protection during halts and induces
retreating skirmishers to face to the front again at an earlier
moment than would otherwise be the case.</p>

<p>“It should not be forgotten, however, that time gained
is of greater benefit to the defender than to the assailant.
Moreover, the great difficulty of inducing a firing line which
has made a lodgment under hostile fire, to advance from its
laboriously constructed cover, admonishes us to be cautious
in employing the spade during an attack. The construction
of cover ought never to impair the desire for making an impetuous
attack, or destroy the offensive spirit.” (Par. 313 German
I. D. R.).</p>

<p>When a body of troops intrenches during an attack, it
must detach half of its force to keep up the attack; this cannot
be offset by an increased rate of fire, even if squad leaders,
range finders, and musicians, take part in the fight, as the men
offer a taller target while intrenching, and as the newly turned
earth facilitates the enemy’s aim. A superiority of fire that
has been gained may thereby be lost. However, when the
defender’s troops have been so shaken that the assailant can
detach half of his rifles with impunity, the latter need not
remain lying on the ground, but can advance, in most cases,
closer to the enemy’s position. The use of the spade is, therefore,
proper only when ground that has been gained is to be
held, and when the enemy’s fire permits intrenching.</p>

<p><b>Russia.</b> In instructions issued by General Kuropatkin, the following
statement in regard to the Japanese infantry appears: “It advances
in widely deployed lines. The firing line advances by short, alternating
rushes, the men then throwing themselves down and intrenching. In spite
of our extraordinarily violent fire, the firing line continues to advance by
alternate rushes, leaves its half completed shelter trenches and begins to
dig new ones. The supports then advance by alternate rushes, occupy the
first line of trenches and complete them. When the firing line advances
from the second line of trenches, they are occupied by the supports, while
the reserves move up into the first line of trenches. In this manner, the
advance is continued by successive rushes. From this, it is apparent that
the infantryman in the firing line must act on his own initiative in selecting
a point for intrenching.”</p>

<p><b>Japan.</b> In a number of cases, the Japanese conducted an attack in the
manner described. At Liao Yang, on September 1st, 1904, shelter trenches
were dug at 750 and at 530 m. from the Russian position. The advance
beyond this was so managed that the men intrenched after every rush,
finally arriving, in the course of the day, within 300 m. of the enemy.
An assault made from this position on the afternoon of the 2nd was
repulsed. The whole Japanese line again faced to the front on arriving
in the shelter trenches which they had dug 300 m. from the hostile position.
The Japanese now perfected their weak intrenchments and were
even able to repulse two counter-attacks made by the Russians. This was
certainly an exceptional case, and, besides, it involved an attack on a
fortified position.</p>

<p>The German Manual of Field Engineering (No. 46) recommends that
the man, when lying on his left side, construct in the first place a parapet
30 cm. high, as head cover and rifle rest. This produces pits 50 cm. wide,
60 cm. long, and 40 cm. deep, usually deeper in front than in rear, which
makes aiming uncomfortable.</p>

<p><b>France.</b> According to the <cite>Instruction pratique sur les travaux de
campagne</cite> (24th October, 1906), the men are to improve available cover;
where natural cover is wanting, artificial cover is to be constructed when
the hostile fire compels a halt or the men are forced to halt to regain
their breath. At short ranges, the skirmishers dig individual pits. It is
desirable for the soldier to use his knapsack as cover while working, and
to leave it in position later also, to get better head cover.</p>

<p><b>England.</b> Although the troops are not equipped with portable intrenching
tools, it is prescribed that captured positions be fortified; in
open country, when the hostile fire is too hot, this is to be done at
night.</p>

<p>The suggestion of creating cover for skirmishers by using the pits
produced by short shell salvos, is a singular one. Detailed experiments
have been made in <b>Austria</b>.<a id="FNanchor421" href="#Footnote421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
In instructions issued by the commander<span class="pagenum" id="Page393">[393]</span>
of the XIth Corps, it was recommended that, when exposed to moderate
hostile fire, the soldier should hug the ground as closely as possible while at
work. The intrenching proceeded most rapidly when the soldier first
excavated the ground in front and threw it forward. But in order to do
this, the man has to push himself backward during the work and must
throw the earth some distance. The parapet is low, but affords sufficient
protection.</p>

<p>The task is greater when the soldier lies first on his left, then on
his right side, removes earth from a borrow pit at his right and then
from one on his left, and piles it up in front. As the skirmisher lies on
the natural surface of the ground during this operation, he naturally
constructs a higher parapet.</p>

<p>The following general rules governing the use of the
spade in attack may be laid down:</p>

<p>1. An invariable use of the spade in attack must be
unhesitatingly condemned. The best means of gaining the
superiority of fire, and the best protection against hostile fire,
is our own fire.</p>

<p>2. It must not be left to the soldier’s discretion, as to
whether or not he shall intrench. The order for intrenching
should in every case emanate from the supreme commander.</p>

<p>3. As a rule, the spade should be used in those phases
of combat that partake more of a defensive character, in <span class="nowrap">particular&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(a) To protect artillery and prepare rallying positions
during the preparatory stage of the action;</p>

<p>(b) To shelter troops detailed to contain the enemy
while enveloping movements are in progress;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page394">[394]</span></p>

<p>(c) To shelter troops that are to keep down the hostile
fire by their own delivered from enfilading or commanding
positions;</p>

<p>(d) To maintain a strip of ground or a supporting point
that has just been gained, whether this has been captured from
the enemy or whether the attack has come to a standstill at
that point and a pause in the fighting occurs.</p>

<p>4. An attack with the aid of the spade from trench to
trench is advisable only in exceptional cases, when the attack
is a purely frontal one and is made over ground devoid of
cover.</p>

<p>The infantry attack may be characterized as a fire fight.
It would seem desirable to surround the enemy’s zone of
approach, or the position one wishes to attack, from the very
outset with a dense, continuous line of rifles, and to overcome
the resistance of the enemy in the earliest phases of the combat
by means of an overwhelming volume of fire from as many
rifles as possible. The impediments that stand in the way of
carrying out this idea lie in the terrain, the ignorance of the
enemy’s position, and in human nature. The defender can be
driven from his position only by an attack; the impulse for
an advance must be given by fresh troops; and the success
gained by the firing line must be clinched by a retained assaulting
force. The necessity of having a formed body of troops
available, until the fight is in full swing, to meet unforeseen
contingencies, further requires that a reserve be provided.
Organizations should not be broken up any more than is absolutely
necessary. The number of troops which the commander
will retain for the time being, will depend upon the amount of<span class="pagenum" id="Page395">[395]</span>
information he has in regard to the situation. During an
attack the reserve is frequently not designated until a preparatory
position is taken up. In attack about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub>-<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub>, and in
defense <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>6</sub>-<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> of the whole force is put in the reserve,
depending upon whether the ensuing action is to be a purely
defensive one or the decision is sought.</p>

<p>The reserve enables the commander to “shift the center
of gravity of the fight to the point desired by him, to reinforce
his line where he considers proper, to equalize fluctuations of
the combat, and, finally, to bring about the decision.” (Par.
294 German I. D. R.). As the combat progresses, the commander
must decide whether the situation is such as to compel
him to employ the reserves to cover his retreat,<a id="FNanchor423" href="#Footnote423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> or whether
it is proper for him to put in his last troops for the purpose of
gaining the victory. If the reserve has been put in and the
attack fails (or, as at Wörth, the defender succumbs after putting
in all the reserves) defeat is certain; but it would be a
mistake not to employ the reserve, to keep it in readiness to
cover a possible retreat, if its intervention can yet bring about
a favorable termination of the combat.</p>

<p>On October 15th, in the battle on the <b>Shaho</b>, the general reserve of
the army consisted of 32 battalions belonging to five different divisions
and five different army corps. In his order for the battle, Kuropatkin laid
particular stress on the necessity of forming reserves (Army Orders dated
August 15th, 1904): “Keeping back more than half of the force in
reserve is the best guarantee for success.” On December 27th, 1904, he
made a similar statement.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>The reserves are created to be used; every available man
must participate in the decisive stage of the combat. If the
enemy yields before the reserve is launched, so much the better;
if he does not give way, all the troops that are at hand must
be put in. The main thing is to gain the victory; scruples may
be indulged in afterwards. A defeated commander who leaves
the battlefield with troops that are still partially intact, has not
made the most of the means at his disposal for combat, provided
the situation was such that the launching of the reserves
could have secured the victory. As shown by Hastenbeck
(1757), by Idstedt (1850), and by Bapaume, at the moment
of the crisis there is no sharp dividing line between victory and
defeat, and the reserves may decide the fate of the day. The
decision of Archduke Albrecht, during the battle of Custozza
(1866), to push his last reserves into the fight was worthy of
a great commander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page397">[397]</span></p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In contrast with this, <b>Russia</b> (1904): “In employing the general
reserve, the commander-in-chief must be even more economical than the
troop leader; he should, when necessary, detail single units to support this
or that section, <i>but he should in no case use up his whole reserve before
the decision has occurred</i>.” The failures of the British in the South
African war may likewise be traced in part to a faulty use of the reserves.
Thus, we read in the regulations of 1896: “The reserve should
occupy a favorable defensive position in order to check the enemy in
case of defeat; if the attack succeeds, the reserve should move up into
the position and take charge of the pursuit.”</p>

<p>“Troops that give up a fight are like the swimmer who,
after having made the most inconceivable exertions to swim
across a broad, deep river, shrinks from the last spurt and
drowns, although he need only stretch out his arm to reach
the opposite shore.” (<span class="smcap">Dragomirov</span>).</p>

<p>In employing the reserve, it should be remembered that
the whole available force must be launched at the decisive
moment at the decisive point, and that the commander ought
not to detach portions of the force intended for the decisive
blow for tasks of secondary importance.</p>

was discussed, as to whether it was desirable first to concentrate the
division for action, or to throw the leading battalions into the Tronville
forest, where portions of Lehman’s Brigade were still holding their

by the situation of the IIIrd Army Corps on the afternoon of

contemplate a decisive attack made by large masses on a
narrow front. If these troops which are to clinch the success
gained by the fighting line, are deployed on the front laid down
in regulations, they will be unable to use their weapons. It
isn’t mechanical shock action, but fire effect that decides the
battle. In such a mass of troops, only fractional parts will
be able to fire, the major portion is crowded together and becomes

<p>A brigade, therefore, should not deploy on a front of
1500 m., <i>i.e.</i>, put only about <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> of its men in the first line;
but no objection can be made if the brigade, in moving to the
final decisive assault, at once advances on a front of 2500-3000
m.</p>

<h4>13. THE CONDUCT OF THE LEADERS IN ACTION.</h4>

<p>The difficulties of troop leading increase as the power of
the commander to control and direct all ranks in action by
words of command diminishes. In action, therefore, those
means must be adopted that will facilitate the transmission of
orders. This requires first of all the choice of an appropriate
position for the leader.</p>

<p>The beginning of an action should find the leader as far
forward as possible; during the advance to the battlefield,
with the advance guard (par. 277 German I. D. R.), for
neither messages nor reports, nor a map can adequately take
the place of personal inspection of the situation of the enemy,
of neighboring units, and of the ground. So placed, he can
best direct the first deployment, upon which the future course
of the action so largely depends, secure advantages by making
prompt decisions in face of the enemy, save his own troops
from making detours, handle them in accordance with a definite
plan, and preclude arbitrary action on the part of the commander
of the leading unit.</p>

<p>During the action, the superior commander can influence
the course of the fight, his personal example excepted, only
by employing his reserves. His place is, therefore, near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page400">[400]</span>
reserves, at a point that can be readily found, and never in
the firing line.</p>

<p>A company commander should remain where he believes
he can best control his company, as a rule, perhaps in the
firing line. He provides for the supply and distribution of
ammunition that is brought up from the rear, and regulates the
coöperation of the platoons. (Pars. 216, 457 and 458 German
I. D. R.).</p>

<p>A battalion commander should only in very exceptional
cases take post in the firing line; he should nearly always
remain with parts of the force that are held back for the
time being, but, in any case, where he can effectively supervise
his battalion. The choice of a regimental commander’s position
is influenced by the same considerations; when his regiment
is acting as part of a brigade, he must select his position so
as to facilitate the transmission of orders from brigade headquarters.
The brigade commander will, as a rule, remain near
his reserves, at a point from which he can best overlook the
deployment of his brigade.</p>

<p>On account of the fact that extended order fighting predominates,
leaders of all grades must be particularly careful
to maintain connection between the several parts of their command,
with each other, and with adjoining units, and to preserve
their influence over their firing lines. Superior commanders
should, in addition, see that their troops do not get
out of hand, and all subordinate leaders, after carrying out a
task assigned them, should endeavor promptly to rejoin their
proper commands, or place themselves at the disposal of the
commander of troops still engaged with the enemy.</p>

<p>These requirements will be fulfilled, if superior commanders
order nothing that they should not and cannot order,
and if the officers charged with the execution of the orders
coöperate to attain the desired end, and do not abuse the freedom
of action allowed them.</p>

<p>While subordinate leaders, up to and including company<span class="pagenum" id="Page401">[401]</span>
commanders, are mainly occupied with fire control and fire
direction, and should influence the men by their personal example,
superior commanders have other tasks, which they
must not neglect for the purpose of interfering in the sphere
of action of their subordinates. They can influence the fire
action only by sending the necessary forces to those portions
of the firing line whose fire they wish to augment. An interference
on their part with the action of subordinates is permissible
only in case of obvious misunderstandings or mistakes,
which would cause the combat to take a course other
than that intended. The larger the unit commanded by an
officer, the greater the latitude that must be allowed him.
The leaders should concentrate their attention upon the general
execution of their special tasks as part of the whole scheme,
rather than upon supervision of details. It is by no means
essential for all parts of the force to employ identical means
to attain one and the same object. Every leader should bear
in mind that <i>omission or neglect are greater crimes than a
mistake made in the choice of means</i>.</p>

<p>The initiative of leaders of all grades is the foundation
of great victories in war, but this initiative must neither
jeopardize unity of action nor direct the course of events into
channels not intended by the commander.<a id="FNanchor432" href="#Footnote432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>The best safeguard against the results of an act of unjustifiable
initiative is to ask oneself: “What orders would my
superior have to give me, if he were in my place and knew

<h4>14. UNITED ACTION VERSUS TACTICAL MISSIONS.</h4>

<div class="longquote">

<p>Although no one disputes that victory depends upon a superiority of
fire at the decisive point, yet there is a great diversity of opinion as to
how this superiority is to be attained.</p>

<p>General Bronsart von Schellendorff states:<a id="FNanchor433" href="#Footnote433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> “Every battle seeks to
bring about a decisive victory, but this is, after all, invariably the sum<span class="pagenum" id="Page402">[402]</span>
of local victories. Successful battle-tactics consist of correctly estimating
the tactical value of these local successes and of contriving to gain a
victory at the decisive point; in other words, to manage so that the sum-total
of positive factors will be greater than that of the negative factors.”</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In the opinion of the advocates of this course,<a id="FNanchor434" href="#Footnote434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> unity of action is
attainable by practice and study, but not by set formations. If unity of
action could be ensured in all bodies of troops by means of study and
practice, there would seem to be no reason why the regulations should
lay down still more definite rules to govern the manner in which an
attack should be conducted. The matter is not so simple, however. Bearing
in mind the great latitude that the regulations allow each individual in
choosing the formation which he deems proper in a given case, it is obvious
that many very different procedures may result. This in itself is no
drawback, and to a certain extent this condition must exist, as the task in
hand, the nature of the country, and the existing situation vary. But,
if a given problem can be correctly solved in several ways, it will also admit
of a decidedly incorrect solution; and it is the more likely to be solved
incorrectly, the less study and practice is indulged in by a large part of
the corps of officers, and the less this class of officers finds in existing
regulations as a guide to conduct. When, in spite of undeniable progress,
we see dispersed attacks and an unquestionably incorrect conduct in every
maneuver, and this with a corps of officers nearly all of whom are professional
soldiers, who have had the advantage of study and practice, what
may we expect in war, where the corps of officers will be very largely
composed of officers of the Reserve and Landwehr, who have but very
limited opportunities for study and practice, but who, after the very
first battle, may have to command companies.</p>

sketched above. He makes a distinction between battle-tactics and the

can by no means gain the victory; that can only be done by the
united launching of adequate forces at the decisive point. “No weapon in

<h5>Examples Illustrating the Necessity of a United Attack.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>1. The 26th Infantry Brigade was alarmed and put in march toward
the battlefield to support the advance guard brigade of the VIIth Army<span class="pagenum" id="Page403">[403]</span>
Corps, engaged at <b>Colombey</b>. The commander of the 26th Infantry
Brigade received orders from the commanding general to engage. It
was not necessary for the brigade to provide its own reserve as the 25th
Brigade had been directed to concentrate between Marsilly and Colligny,
and to be at the disposal of the corps commander. The troops already
engaged were in a critical situation; their moral and physical energy was
exhausted. It is only too patent that the first battalion (1st Battalion,
13th Infantry) appearing on the scene was thrown into the fight to afford
at least temporary relief, but this insufficient reinforcement was involved
in the general failure. After about a quarter of an hour, the 25th Brigade
(the IIIrd Battallion, 73rd Infantry had remained in bivouac at Pange)
was concentrating for action at Coincy, but, instead of its making a united
attack, only the 1st Battalion of the 73rd Infantry was launched. This
battalion did, indeed, penetrate into the “Tannenwäldchen” at the “Todten-Allee”,
but was then surrounded on three sides, had to fall back with considerable
losses, prevented the further advance of the IInd Battallion of
the 73rd Infantry, and rallied on the Füsilier Battalion of the 13th Infantry,
on the bank of the Vallières brook. “Although the General Staff
account of the war is silent on this subject, we are justified in assuming
that only the presence of the brigade commander, who had learned a
lesson from the second local assault, prevented the Füsilier Battalion of the
13th Infantry from making a fourth isolated effort. After re-forming the
organizations, the new attack, which was made with indomitable spirit,
proceeded more in connection with that of three other battalions advancing
on the same line, and this united advance was closely followed by a
second echelon consisting of the last battalion of the brigade (the IInd
Battalion of the 13th Infantry), which had arrived just in time. The
result was that the enemy was completely routed.”<a id="FNanchor436" href="#Footnote436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>3. The well executed attack made against the hill west of the suburb
of <b>St. Martin</b>, on January 19th, 1871, by six battalions of the 29th Infantry
Brigade shows the importance of the united launching of a large body of
massed infantry. The engagement of the 16th Infantry Division, in particular
the attack made on <b>Grugies</b> (battle of <b>St. Quentin</b>) is the antithesis
of the above-mentioned attack. Although the situation did not necessitate
the simultaneous launching of the available forces, the brigade attacked
in driblets. The attack made by these fractions, launched one
after another, was not able to bring about a decision. In the first
place, at about 11 A. M., three companies (5th, 6th, and 7th of the 69th<span class="pagenum" id="Page404">[404]</span>
Infantry), soon afterwards supported by the 8th Company of the 29th
Infantry, and the 8th Company of the 69th Infantry, attacked the French
position at the railway embankment and cut. The Prussian troops fought
with great gallantry, the 5th, 6th and 7th Companies of the 69th Infantry
making four attacks, and the other two companies, three. Although these
five companies succeeded in gaining temporary successes, they lacked
a common commander, and were supported from the rear only when they
were thrown back after fighting for three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>About noon, the four companies of the Ist Battalion, 29th Infantry, were
brought up, but did not engage until the first line had been forced back
and the 5th, 6th, and 7th Companies of the 69th Infantry, at any rate,
were out of action for the time being. Incidentally, it may be mentioned
that the Ist Battalion of the 29th Infantry attacked in three groups, the
strongest of which consisted of 2-l/2 companies, the weakest of only half a
company. Only the strongest of these groups scored a success, and the
Ist Battalion of the 29th Infantry was completely routed after a bloody
fight. The 9th and 10th Companies, 29th Infantry, did not arrive on the
battlefield until after the companies of the Ist Battalion of this regiment,
whose heroic fight cannot be sufficiently praised, had ceased to exist as
tactical units.</p>

<p>At 12:30 P. M., the 3rd and 4th Companies of the 70th Infantry were
brought up and threw back the French, but were in their turn defeated.
At this moment the 10th and 11th Companies of the 40th Infantry arrived;
these companies were also able to advance, but their success was a temporary
one only.</p>

<p>At 1:30 P. M., the IInd Battalion of the 40th Infantry appeared, threw
the French back, but was soon attacked by superior forces and suffered
the same fate as its predecessors.</p>

<p>At 2:30 P. M., the Füsilier Battalion of the 70th Infantry and the 9th
and 12th Companies of the 40th Infantry were brought forward, but only
the former engaged seriously at once&mdash;again without success. A little
while later, the 9th and 12th Companies, 40th Infantry, advanced energetically.
At about 3:30 P. M., the French made a very strong counter-attack;
all that had been gained seemed about to be lost again, when
the decision was finally brought about by the vigorous action of the 41st
Infantry and a charge made by Reserve Dragoons.</p>

<p>The capture of Grugies, of the sugar mill, and, a little later, of
Gauchy, now followed.</p>

<p>The resistance of the French was broken. General von Barnekow
had thus, apparently, gained his object; but at what a price? In this engagement,
the launching of troops in driblets may be very accurately
followed:</p>

<p>1. At 11 A. M., five companies were launched in two separate groups
(5th, 6th, and 7th Companies, 69th Infantry&mdash;8th Company, 29th Infantry
and 8th Company, 69th Infantry);</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page405">[405]</span></p>

<p>2. Toward noon, four fresh companies (1st Battalion, 29th Infantry)
were also launched in separate groups;</p>

<p>3. A little later, two fresh companies were put in (9th and 10th
Companies, 29th Infantry);</p>

<p>4. At 12:30 P. M., two fresh companies were launched (3rd and
4th Companies, 70th Infantry);</p>

<p>5. A little later, the 10th and 11th Companies, 40th Infantry, were
pushed in;</p>

<p>6. About 1:30 P. M., the IInd Battalion, 40th Infantry, was brought
up;</p>

<p>7. About 2:30 P. M., the Füsilier Battalion, 70th Infantry, and the 9th
and 12th Companies, 40th Infantry, advanced.</p>

<p>Thus, between 11 A. M. and 2:30 P. M., General von Barnekow gradually
drew into the fight twenty-five companies, in seven different detachments,
from the reserve formed by the 16th Infantry Division at
Essigny le Grand. Besides, the troops generally did not appear on the
battlefield until the energy of the troops already engaged was exhausted.<a id="FNanchor438" href="#Footnote438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the retreat of the several detachments was not a voluntary
one, for the French, thanks to their great superiority, generally forced them
to retire. This engagement thus presents a series of partial successes,
which became reverses, however, in a very short time.</p>

<p><i>Launching reinforcements in driblets increased the numbers required
beyond all reasonable bounds, produced heavy losses, and involved the
weak reinforcements, which arrived successively, in disaster, without turning

<p>“The system of close order battalion tactics was no longer practicable

time of peace.” (The attack made by the 26th Infantry Brigade against

<p>There is always danger that unity of action will be sacrificed by the
continued assignment of individual tasks; that the leader will not be able
to count with confidence on the initiative of subordinate leaders restoring
this unity, and “that, in the end, no higher commander will any longer
have the assurance that his wishes will be carried out.” The battles around
Metz during August, 1870, show a tendency on the part of the infantry to<span class="pagenum" id="Page406">[406]</span>
leave behind, in reserve and in rallying positions, parts of the troops
launched to perform a certain combat task, “to detach parts to maintain
communication (very often not at all endangered) with neighboring detachments”,
and to despatch others to a distance to cover a flank, or to
make a wide turning movement for the purpose of enveloping the enemy’s
flank.</p>

<p>To prevent a battle from degenerating into a number of disconnected,
local combats, and to ensure that the enemy will be actually subjected to the
fire of as many rifles as the supreme commander intended, General von
Scherff proposes that the battle formation, consisting of several echelons
separated by fixed distances, be taken up outside of the zone of hostile
fire, and that these echelons then advance simultaneously and as uninterruptedly
as possible upon the enemy. In this movement the terrain is to
be taken advantage of only so far as the orders permit. In view of the
flat trajectory of the modern rifle, he concedes that fire while in motion,
formerly considered permissible by him at long and medium ranges, may be
replaced by an advance by rushes of the firing line, alternating with firing
in a prone position, the ammunition to be expended at each halt being
fixed by the officer charged with fire direction. He moreover considers
it necessary to have a main firing position, located approximately at the
outer limit of short ranges, for the purpose of gaining the superiority of
fire. Base units must be designated in order to prevent weak detachments
from encountering the enemy single-handed. Moreover, he intends to
keep the advance going by increasing the fire, and by detailed and definite
orders providing for the constant reinforcement of the firing line by men
of the steadily following supports and reserves. Further, since according
to his proposal, a halt by the rear echelons of an attack that has once been
launched, is excluded on principle, it follows of necessity, that, for the
fire effect of the firing line at the really decisive ranges, there can remain
only a very brief period of time, measurable in minutes, which is amply
sufficient, in his opinion, for the object to be accomplished.</p>

<p>It is charged that General von Scherff’s proposal<a id="FNanchor440" href="#Footnote440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
(see <a href="#Page205">p. 205</a> supra)
favors a set scheme for conducting every fight. This is not true; there
is quite a difference between “more definitely regulating the conduct of
an attack”, aimed at by the author of <cite>Kriegslehren</cite>, and the formulation
of a normal procedure.</p>

<p>“Where a number of individuals are to coöperate for the purpose of
performing a certain task, the nature of the case requires that each one
be able to picture to himself beforehand the nature of the task, so that
his share in it will appear clear and definite. Each one must know what
he is to do, when and where he should engage, what his role is to be,
etc. etc., or the result will be hopeless confusion.”&mdash;“The drill regulations<span class="pagenum" id="Page407">[407]</span>
must supply this picture and the drill-ground is the place where its
general forms should be impressed upon every individual participating
in the performance of a task.” Experience has taught us that this image
of the drill-ground becomes distorted in war through influences which
have almost never permitted it to appear on the battlefield in its true
form. The initiative of subordinate leaders should overcome the obstacles
which stand in the way of a realization of this ideal image.</p>

<p><b>The system of tactical missions</b> reckons with the sum-total of
local successes, assigns tasks to the different units of command, and
leaves to the latter the choice of the means, without restricting their
independence. The course of the combat can be influenced only by the
action of retained forces, and it is sought to produce united action by
acquainting all leaders with the object of the combat, they in turn endeavoring
to attain this object even though they do so in different ways.</p>

<p><b>The system of united action</b> seeks to ensure victory by simultaneously
placing in readiness all the forces intended for the general combat,
by an orderly concentration for action, and by launching the troops at one
and the same time, without, however, requiring all parts of the force
to employ the same formations. This system dictates to the leader the
number of troops he should launch. Since in action everything is ordered
as necessity therefor arises, the result is that the leader loses sight of the
general action in view of the great number of separate orders that must
be issued.</p>

<p>In the system of tactical missions, there is danger of arbitrary action
on the part of subordinates, and of dispersion; moreover, it is not always
easy to deploy strong firing lines, and there is an increased tendency to
overestimate the value of cover and, in consequence, to overstep the
assigned frontage.</p>

<p>The system of united action is open to the objection that initiative of
the individual disappears and that the rules laid down in drill regulations
degenerate into a pattern devoid of all spirit.</p>

<p>In <b>Austria</b> (1906), Captain Wachtel<a id="FNanchor441" href="#Footnote441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> suggests that, when a decision
is not sought, an attack in groups be made, and that, when a decision
is sought, a united attack be made. In <b>Switzerland</b>, Major Sonderegger<a id="FNanchor442" href="#Footnote442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>

<p>The initiative of the individual should carry the troops over difficulties

frequently from the time a force enters the zone of effective hostile fire until

<p>The invariable guiding principle in defense is to make
the most profitable use of fire. This principle governs in the
selection of a position and in strengthening it artificially.</p>

<p>The defender’s object may <span class="nowrap">be&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. <b>Temporary occupation</b> of a piece of ground;</p>

<p>2. <b>Purely passive defense</b>, outpost, rear guard, and
delaying actions;</p>

<p>3. <b>Offensive-defensive action</b>, <i>i.e.</i>, to bring about a
decision by combining the offensive with the defensive.</p>

<p>In fortress warfare, situations may arise which may
make it necessary to hold a piece of ground obstinately, without
it being possible to assume the offensive. In the French,
Russian, and Italian regulations, only the offensive-defensive
is considered. The Italians see in the defensive nothing but
a preparation for the offensive; the Russians seek to shake
the enemy with fire in defense, so that they can subsequently
assume the offensive.</p>

<p>The defensive is dependent upon the terrain, and is subject
to the condition that the locality where the tactical situation
requires a stand to be made offers a position favorable for
employing fire to good advantage, and that the opponent
actually attacks where the defender expects him. The employment
of the defensive is restricted by its dependence on the
ground and on the measures of the enemy. Its employment
may frequently be explained by the fact that one of the contending
parties allows itself to be checked to such an extent
by the initiative of the other that it can only offer a passive
resistance. Such passive resistance may here and there score<span class="pagenum" id="Page409">[409]</span>
a success by chance (Plevna, St. Privat), but, as a rule, only
the assailant reaps a benefit from such situations.</p>

<h4>1. THE PASSIVE DEFENSE</h4>

<p class="noindent">seeks to avoid a decision, and must therefore endeavor, by
opening fire at an early moment, to prevent the enemy from
reaching short ranges. (See <a href="#Page147">p. 147</a> supra). It is not absolutely
necessary to have a clear field of fire or strong reserves, but the
latter, kept a considerable distance in rear, must be strong
enough to enable the force to disengage itself from the enemy.</p>

<p>Since only a temporary resistance is to be made, it is
permissible for the force to cover a greater front. The defender
should endeavor to compensate for his numerical inferiority
by expending a large amount of ammunition and by
employing machine guns. It is an advantage to have obstacles
in front of the position and cover in rear of it, because the
former retard the enemy’s advance and the latter shelters the
troops from his fire in case of a retreat.</p>

<h4 title="2. THE DEFENSE SEEKING A DECISION.">2. THE DEFENSE SEEKING A
DECISION.<a id="FNanchor444" href="#Footnote444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote444" href="#FNanchor444" class="label">[444]</a> During the attack on the large work at Gorni Dubniac, the Finnland
Regiment was unable to advance from its last position, only 70-100 paces distant
from the enemy, over the foreground swept by grazing fire. Several
attempted assaults were repulsed.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Decisive results can only be obtained at short and medium
ranges. Long range fire may, indeed, inflict losses on the
enemy and delay his advance, but it cannot repulse him.
(See <a href="#Page148">p. 148</a> supra).</p>

<p>It is not sufficient merely to ward off the attack with
fire; the offensive must be assumed. When this is not done,
the assailant can repair his losses and try another attack.
When the defender has repulsed the enemy, he should follow
up this success with an attack. However, as he will rarely
be able to do this with the force at his disposal, fresh troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page410">[410]</span>
will be required. (Beaune la Rolande, Lisaine). The change
from the tactical defensive to the offensive offers the same
difficulties as the corresponding strategical move; but, in the
former case, there is present, in addition, the element of
danger and the difficulty of perceiving the right moment.<a id="FNanchor445" href="#Footnote445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote445" href="#FNanchor445" class="label">[445]</a> <cite>Taktik</cite>,

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>A position is of value only when it compels the enemy
to attack, directs his movements into definite channels, and
induces him to make wide turning movements, which cause him
to lose time and produce favorable conditions for the assumption
of the offensive on the part of the defender. Every
position that enables the defender to use all his weapons, and
does not deter the enemy from making an attack, is suitable
for this purpose.</p>

<p>“By placing our troops in an unassailable position, we
actually refuse battle and force the enemy to seek the decision
in another manner. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* A defensive position approaches
its ideal to the extent that its strength is hidden and opportunity
is offered of surprising the enemy by our tactical combinations.
One should endeavor to conceal the advantages
which one intends to derive from the formation of the ground,
just as one hides from the enemy the bulk of one’s troops
and their actual position. This is, indeed, only practicable to
a certain extent, and requires perhaps a peculiar and little used
method of treatment.”<a id="FNanchor446" href="#Footnote446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote446" href="#FNanchor446" class="label">[446]</a>
<span class="smcap">Clausewitz</span>, <cite>On War</cite>, VI, 12 (<cite>Militär-Klassiker</cite>, p. 364). The Boers were
masters of the art of concealing defensive positions. At Colenso, on the Modder
River, and at Magersfontain, their positions were located in places where
neither the British artillerists nor the reconnoitering detachments suspected
them to be.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Modern firearms make the defense so strong in front
that it suffices to hold this part of the position with a weak
force supplied with plenty of ammunition, and provided with
weak supports, at a few points, to replace losses. As these
supports have a definite task to perform, they are posted as
near the first line as the available cover permits, in order to
cut down the distance to be traversed by them under fire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page411">[411]</span>
When practicable, they are intrenched within the firing line
itself. As it is advisable to supply these troops with a great
deal of ammunition, some of the ammunition wagons belonging
to the battalions held in reserve may be turned over to
them. The general reserve intended for offensive action should
be kept far in rear of the line. When kept too close to the
first line, the defender will be unable to move it to any point
desired, after the direction of the attack becomes apparent.
The defender should examine his position from the point of
view of the attacker, and ask himself, “<i>With how weak a
force may I occupy the position and still obtain the frontal
strength described in the regulations, and how strong can I
make the general reserve so as to bring about a decision?</i>”</p>

<p>At some parts of the position, an attack will have good
prospects of succeeding, at others it would encounter difficulties,
and, finally, at others it could not possibly succeed.
While many troops are needed in the first-mentioned portions
(sections), comparatively few troops will suffice to hold those
sections which are less favorable for the attacker (on account
of their free field of fire, obstacles, and the absence of artillery
positions in which the attacker can place his guns). This
leads to a division of the defensive position into sections, each
forming a separate unit of command (battalion or company)
and, when necessary, detailing its own reserve (section
reserve). When the frontage of the sections, as determined by
the above-mentioned examination of the position, is considerable,
or when obstacles lie within the position, a further subdivision
may become necessary. This does not imply that the
position must be held in equal strength all along the line; portions
of the line that are very difficult to attack need only be
kept under observation. Gaps in the defensive line are, as a
rule, of very little value to the assailant, as the defender will
frequently be able to sweep the space in front of them from
a flank. “In order to keep all parts of the foreground under
observation, and to prevent portions of the hostile force from
escaping the defender’s fire, a division of the foreground corresponding<span class="pagenum" id="Page412">[412]</span>
to the division into sections must be made when
necessary.” (Par. 403 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>Weak points, <i>i.e.</i>, points against which the assailant
can suddenly mass superior forces at short range, or in the
defense of which a coöperation of infantry and artillery is
impossible, must be specially strengthened: by obstacles; provision
for flanking the hostile advance; and preparation of
supporting points in rear of the position. In addition, such
weak points must be occupied with a strong garrison, by
employing two firing lines, one above the other; reserves;
and machine guns.</p>

<p>Enclosed farm yards (Point du Jour, on August 18th,
1870), and small patches of timber, are best not occupied at
all; they are far more valuable as sham defenses in that they
draw the fire of the assailant. At any rate, it is a question
whether, at the last moment, when the hostile assault must be
warded off, it will be possible to occupy such points.</p>

<p>As a general rule, only a single defensive position, consisting
of an infantry and an artillery line, is selected.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The Russians invariably posted strong advanced detachments in
front of their main defensive positions. As a result, the most serious
fights usually occurred in the positions taken up by these advanced troops.<a id="FNanchor447" href="#Footnote447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>
At <b>Haicheng</b>, for example, a strong main position had been prepared,
in which a stand was to be made. In spite of this, the IInd Siberian
Corps was left in a strongly fortified advanced position west of <b>Simutcheng</b>.
This corps, in its turn, fortified two lines of advanced positions
far in its front.</p>

<p>“Thus, on July 31, 1904, only seven battalions of this corps finally
fought at <b>Daputsi</b> and <b>Liadapu</b>. When they were thrown back by superior
forces, the mistake was made of bringing up fresh troops to regain
the position captured by the enemy. These troops arrived too late and
had to make a difficult attack on the Japanese, who had already occupied
the captured position. Naturally their frontal attack accomplished
nothing.</p>

<p>“The force thus suffered a defeat needlessly, and, although the defensive
had been decided upon, a lot of men were sacrificed in an attempt
to retake an advanced position that had been captured by the enemy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page413">[413]</span>
The corps evacuated its strong position without a fight when its line of
retreat was endangered by Mistshenko’s being forced back. The Russians
likewise evacuated their main position at Haicheng when news was received

<p>As a rule, it is not advisable to occupy <b>advanced positions</b>,<a id="FNanchor449" href="#Footnote449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
<i>i.e.</i>, positions lying within effective range of the main
position. Supporting points immediately in front of the main
position, projecting from it like caponiers, and flanking the
ground over which the assailant will have to make his attack,
must not be confounded with these advanced positions. St.
Hubert and St. Marie aux Chênes, on the battlefield of Gravelotte
are good examples of both classes of positions. In order
to gain time, a commander may sometimes find it advantageous
to occupy and temporarily defend advanced positions lying
still farther to the front. (Lisaine, and Shaho). In doing
this, favorable terrain (Chavannes on the Lisaine) and skillful
leadership are essential.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote449" href="#FNanchor449" class="label">[449]</a> <cite>Taktik</cite>, V,
p. 270, et seq. No objection can be made to the contemplated
construction of advanced positions in front of the Shaho position, as the Russians
desired to gain time for the offensive movement to be made by their left
wing. The uncertainty and hesitation produced by the constant changes in
orders, and the excessive reinforcement of the advanced detachments, which
allowed themselves to be led into making a stubborn defense, was fatal.</p>

<p>In <b>France</b> and <b>Russia</b> much is expected of advanced positions. In

best be left unoccupied, unless they can be supported by artillery fire
from the main position.</p>

<p>“Smokeless powder and the great range of modern firearms will
frequently make reconnaissance so difficult that it will be possible to
gain an approximate idea of the enemy’s strength only by a fight. For
this reason, in situations similar to that existing west of Belfort, in
January 1871, advanced detachments, whose mission it is to deceive the
enemy as to the defender’s strength, and to compel him to deploy, will
have a greater justification now than at that time. Nowadays, such detachments
may cover a considerable front without danger, especially
when they are plentifully supplied with ammunition. This will make it<span class="pagenum" id="Page414">[414]</span>
still more easy to deceive the enemy, and a skillful defender will know
how to make the most of it.”<a id="FNanchor450" href="#Footnote450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>Advanced positions<a id="FNanchor451" href="#Footnote451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> are apt to mask the fire from the
main position, and fights for their possession may easily lead
to the defeat of the troops holding them. The danger of the
fight taking place and being decided in the advanced position
must be reckoned with. (Battles of Ligny and on the Hallue).
On the other hand, it may be advantageous to employ scouting
detachments, cyclists, and machine guns, and to construct
dummy intrenchments in front of the main position. (Par.
407 German I. D. R.). The French, more than anyone else,
are convinced of the advantages to be derived from an employment
of advanced positions (for example in deceiving the
enemy as to the location of the main position). In a deliberately
planned concentration and advance into action, such positions
are, however, so effectively enveloped that they do not
come into play at all and fall an easy prey to the enemy. However,
we do not wish to deny their occasional usefulness in
cases where it is necessary to gain time for concentration and
for strengthening the main position. In fights for their possession,
an idea may frequently be gained of the intentions and
dispositions of the assailant. Moreover, they offer opportunities
for surprising the enemy with fire, and induce him to make
premature attacks and to mass his troops in the ones he has
captured.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Next to a free field of fire (clearing the foreground, and
ascertaining ranges), the determining factors in selecting a
position are elbow room in and in rear of the position, supporting
points for the flanks, and cover. The natural cover
available on the ground is made use of as best suits the purpose
of the action.</p>

<p>The line in which the artillery intends to fight the decisive
action constitutes the “framework” of the position. Although<span class="pagenum" id="Page415">[415]</span>
artillery will rarely be able to perform all its tasks in a single
position, its first position is selected with due regard to the
position of the hostile artillery. The most important position
is that from which the hostile infantry attack is to be repulsed.
This should be selected far enough in front of the artillery
to enable the latter to fire over it, and to deprive the assailant’s
artillery of the opportunity of hitting the defender’s infantry
and artillery at one and the same time. (Par. 401 German
I. D. R.). A distance of 600 m. between infantry and artillery
is considered sufficient for this purpose. In view of the protection
afforded by gun shields against infantry fire, it is
scarcely necessary to post skirmish lines in advance of the
artillery. But, where the infantry line is not continuous in
front of the artillery, troops should be posted, so as to protect
the artillery personnel from being annoyed by hostile patrols.
It will seldom be possible for a commander to do justice to the
requirements of both arms; in every compromise, one or the
other arm is only too apt to be placed at a disadvantage. The
needs of the infantry, whose choice of a position is more
restricted, take precedence. While infantry can govern its
action by that of the artillery during the preparatory stage of
an attack, this is impossible in defense, as the infantry is obliged
to carry the fight through to its logical conclusion in the position
in which it is begun.<a id="FNanchor452" href="#Footnote452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote452" href="#FNanchor452" class="label">[452]</a> As the artillery is less restricted in the choice of positions, and as the
final outcome of the fight depends, after all, on the outcome of the infantry
action, the demands of the infantry, contrary to par. 292 German I. D. R.,
must be considered in the first place.</p>

the French regulations, are no longer to be found in the new<span class="pagenum" id="Page416">[416]</span>

time, if they are to be of value, and if they are to give
leaders and troops the assurance that they can be defended
by the minimum number of men.<a id="FNanchor454" href="#Footnote454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Even intrenchments that
have been constructed in vain will frequently prove useful
in deceiving the enemy. In many cases, it will be necessary
to be prepared to meet a hostile attack made from several
directions. This contingency should be taken into account by
at least preparing for the work beforehand.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote454" href="#FNanchor454" class="label">[454]</a> At 10 A. M., on August 18th, 1870. General Canrobert received orders to
place St. Privat in a state of defense. At 11 A. M., the first reports of the
approach of the Prussian Guard were received, and at 4 P. M., Ste. Marie aux
Chênes was in German hands. Hence, only five hours were available for these
preparations for defense.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“If the situation turns out to be different than was
expected, the intrenchments already constructed should not
influence the decisions of the commander. On the other
hand, the consideration that the works might be built unnecessarily
must not cause their construction to be omitted altogether.”
(Par. 311 German I. D. R.).</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In the preface to the French regulations, it is emphasized that intrenching
a position ought neither to impair the spirit of the offensive
nor hamper the movement to the front. “Intrenchments are a means to
an end, but not the end itself. They should only be used when no violence
is done thereby to the tactical situation, and one should never hesitate,
for a single moment, to abandon them, if the situation requires, or to
construct others, at another place, if it becomes necessary.” The men
should therefore be trained in handling the portable intrenching tools,
until they can use them skillfully in any position of the body.</p>

<p>“The use of intrenchments may also be abused. To remain inertly
in a place is just as fatal as to advance without making use of cover.
When temporary halts are made, the commander for the time being, often
placed in that position by chance (<i>chef du moment, chef d’unité ou chef de
groupe éventuel</i>), indicates whether or not intrenchments are to be constructed.”</p>

<p>Battle intrenchments are to protect the soldier against hostile fire,
without hampering him in using his rifle. “They are one of the factors
which ensure economy in men, in that they save a body of troops from
suffering unnecessary losses. But their importance always recedes before
the general requirements of an action, and they should never in any way
interfere with the advance of troops; on the contrary, intrenchments are<span class="pagenum" id="Page417">[417]</span>
to make it possible to bring troops within effective range of the enemy,
without impairing their physical condition or their morale.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>Intrenchments enable a commander to save troops, which
he can use offensively at the decisive point. They do not fulfill
the object for which they were intended, when they make it
easier for the enemy to pick out the position. “Works which
cannot be perceived from the foreground even through powerful
field glasses, afford the most effective protection against
artillery fire.” Trenches should therefore be deep, have a
low parapet, and be properly masked.</p>

<p>The commander indicates when work is to begin. Every
unit must intrench the portion of the defensive line which
it is to defend; working parties, specially detailed from troops
not intended for the immediate defense of the position, can
be counted on only when extensive works are to be constructed.</p>

<p>Continuous lines of trenches are seldom built; it suffices
to construct a line of works with intervals, <i>i.e.</i>, battalion
groups, the intervals being simply held by a weak force.</p>

<p>These battalion groups (par. 24 German Manual of
Field Engineering) are constructed without regard to any
fixed form, as the tactical employment of the companies
requires. They consist of firing trenches (flanks refused and
echelons in rear of the wings), provided with splinter proofs,
and adequate cover trenches, so that all the men, if possible,
will be sheltered from artillery fire.</p>

<p>The aim is, first of all, to construct inconspicuous standing
firing trenches. These should have low parapets and be
provided with numerous traverses to restrict the effect of high
explosive shell. In order that these traverses may not betray
the location of the position, they should not rise above the
parapet.<a id="FNanchor455" href="#Footnote455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote455" href="#FNanchor455" class="label">[455]</a> These traverses afford very little shelter against enfilading fire; it is
advisable to keep sand bags in readiness as a protection in case such fire is
received.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page418">[418]</span></p>

<p>Deep, narrow trenches afford the best protection against
artillery fire (the trench should be about 0.60 m. wide at
the bottom). Narrow trenches are especially difficult to pick
out from a balloon. In constructing trenches having no
parapet at all, special precautions must be taken in order that
their location may not be betrayed by the scattered earth or
by their rear wall, which will be visible when they are located
on the slope facing the enemy. When the trenches are to
be held for some time, provision must be made for the construction
of splinter proofs,<a id="FNanchor456" href="#Footnote456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> other overhead cover, and loopholes
of observation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote456" href="#FNanchor456" class="label">[456]</a> These lie about 0.50 m. below the natural surface of the ground and
accommodate 5-6 men: they are separated from each other by an earth wall
1 m. thick.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Numerous light splinter proofs are generally to be preferred
to a few larger and stronger ones, as they afford sufficient
protection against shrapnel bullets and fragments. They
may be protected against direct hits from field guns, or other
guns having a flat trajectory, by sloping their roofs to the
rear at an angle as nearly as possible coincident with the angle
of fall of those projectiles.</p>

<p>Since field intrenchments are incapable of furnishing protection
against direct hits from guns having a curved trajectory,
this object must be attained by skillfully distributing splinter
proofs along the front. These should be inconspicuous and
should not take up too much room. The comfort of the troops
in the trenches should also be provided for by constructing
kitchens, latrines, drainage ditches, and dressing stations.</p>

<p>In addition, field magazines for storing ammunition should
be built, and alarm arrangements made. Moreover, covered
communication should be provided along the line and to the
rear. The front and gaps in the line may be very effectively
flanked by fire from skillfully constructed refused wings.</p>

<p>1. <b>Observation of the foreground</b>, “for the purpose of
reconnaissance and security, as well as for noting the effect of
one’s own fire.” In order that observers may not betray the
location of the position, it is recommended that they be posted
at inconspicuous points affording a sufficiently extended view,<span class="pagenum" id="Page421">[421]</span>
and screened from the observation of the enemy. When they
have to be posted in the defensive line, the terreplein is either
lowered in places, so that they can just look over the parapet,
or special observation stations are constructed. Provision must
be made for communication between the several parts of the
line and with the next higher headquarters.</p>

<p>2. <b>Clearing the foreground.</b> As a rule, it will be practicable
to employ for this work troops not needed in digging
trenches. As time is lacking in field warfare for extensive
work, such as cutting down embankments and removing dead
angles, one will have to be content with trampling down or
burning standing grain, removing objects which the enemy
might use as aiming points, and cutting clearings through
woods. It is not advisable to demolish stone walls and houses,
as the debris is difficult to remove and affords cover to the
enemy.</p>

<p>3. <b>Dummy intrenchments and masks.</b><a id="FNanchor457" href="#Footnote457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> These are to
deceive the assailant as to the position and extent of the
defensive works. They should not be located in the same
fire swept zone as the defensive works themselves, and at a
distance should look like real fortifications. Masks are to
screen defensive works or troops, without restricting the fire
of the latter. Natural features are best suited for this purpose,
but may be replaced or supplemented by artificial masks.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote457" href="#FNanchor457" class="label">[457]</a> <cite>Taktik</cite>, V, p. 291. At Magersfontain, the Boers constructed dummy
trenches on the crest, while the trenches actually held by them were located at
the foot of the slope. The result is well known.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In many cases, it will suffice to place a few skirmishers
behind a parapet that has been hastily thrown up with a plow.</p>

<p>4. <b>Cover trenches and communicating trenches.</b>
These constitute a considerable portion of the defensive works.
Communicating trenches may be either covered ways or zigzags,
and connect the cover trenches with the firing trenches.
Sortie steps should be provided in order to facilitate a prompt
advance from the trenches. In many cases, it is impossible to
avoid placing firing and cover trenches so close to each other
that the enemy’s shells can strike both simultaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page422">[422]</span></p>

<p>5. <b>Obstacles.</b> These need only be constructed when
two forces confront each other for a protracted period. The
purpose of obstacles is to hold the enemy where he will be
exposed to the most deadly fire; retard his advance; compel him
to confine his movements to certain avenues of approach (this
is especially valuable in night combats); and eliminate dead
angles in front of the position. The presence of extensive
obstacles forces the enemy to advance systematically. As a
rule, they can only be removed by pioneers. They should not
be located too near the position, as they are apt to be damaged
by artillery fire directed at the position, and interfere with the
defender’s fire. When they are too far in front of the position,
the defender will not be able to guard them and prevent their
destruction. In general, they should not be more than 200 m.
from the position. It is better to construct several lines of small
obstacles than a single line of large ones. The requirement
that obstacles must not interfere with the defender’s fire, must
not afford the enemy an opportunity to approach under cover,
and must remain intact under hostile artillery fire, is best
met by marshy ground and by wire entanglements. Obstacles
should be provided with a slight glacis in order to prevent
artillery fire from destroying them prematurely. When wire
entanglements are too high, they are easily seen at a distance,
and, although they are little damaged by artillery fire, the
attacker can make preparations to remove them.</p>

<h5>Russian Views.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>A defensive position consists of an advanced position, a fighting line
with firing trenches and batteries, supporting points in rear, and, finally,
a fourth line, which serves as a rallying position. The key to a position,
which lay formerly in the line of supporting points, lies at present in the
firing trenches in which supporting points must be provided. (Colonel
Golenkin advocates the use of semi-circular works as supporting points,
and Lieutenant-Colonel Mordovin large closed works). “These semi-circular
works are in a sense the anchors by means of which the firing
line clings to the position which it has occupied.” It does not matter if
the enemy penetrates the first line and captures one or two of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page423">[423]</span>
supporting points, for others remain on either side; the latter and the
second line of supporting points then form a new though somewhat
indented defensive line. As the attacking force which has penetrated
into the position, is hemmed in on both sides, it will hardly be able to
sustain the counter-attack made by the defender’s reserves, and its temporary
success will turn into defeat. But, in order that this may be
accomplished, a second line of supporting points is absolutely essential.
Large closed works of high command, but a smaller number than is
employed in the first line, are recommended for this purpose. According
to Russian opinions, several lines of fortifications are essential in order
to check an enemy who has penetrated the first line, and to facilitate the
defender’s final retreat in case of necessity.</p>

<p>Particular importance is attached to advanced positions, to positions
for the reserves, echeloned to the right and left rear of the flanks, and,
finally, to rallying positions. Advanced positions are either to serve
“reconnaissance purposes,” by forcing the enemy to an early deployment,
or to do duty as “caponiers” from which a flanking fire may be brought to
bear on the foreground.</p>

<p>Advanced positions, doing duty as “caponiers,” are invariably to
consist of closed works, those serving “reconnaissance purposes” of open
works. The latter are to be defended “to the last ditch,” and are not to
be evacuated until the enemy approaches to about 400 m. or less, but
the garrison is not to allow itself to become involved in a bayonet fight.</p>

<p>In contrast with this distribution in depth&mdash;2 km., in the model given&mdash;Lieutenant-Colonel
Jabel, whose views are based on the same experiences,
advocates the use of only one line of fortifications. He states:
“The length of the battles, which sometimes lasted two weeks, as well
as the terrible intensity of fire in general and artillery fire in particular,
produced such an absolute nervous exhaustion that the decisive action
could be fought only in a single line. With its capture, further fighting
had only small prospects of success *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*” “When firing trenches
have been constructed at the points where the best effect can be obtained
from long and short range fire, they should not be evacuated prematurely,
but held, in order to make the most of this fire effect, until the
enemy arrives close enough to use his bayonets. If the troops holding
the trenches retire immediately before the bayonet fight, their retreat
invariably becomes a rout, and, in any case, entails tremendous losses, for,
after leaving their trenches, they will be helpless and exposed in the open
to the hostile fire.”</p>

<h4>4. THE CONDUCT OF THE DEFENSE.</h4>

<p>In his <cite>Tactical Handbook</cite>, Major Hoppenstedt suggests a
method, well meriting attention, for decreasing the effect of
artillery fire on a defensive position. He believes that dummy<span class="pagenum" id="Page424">[424]</span>
intrenchments, not too conspicuously located, partially, but not
skillfully masked and occupied, will deceive the attacker’s
artillery for some time, at any rate, until the advanced troops
of the attacker induce the defenders to man their parapet and
expose themselves to shrapnel fire. The “defense should be
conducted in such a manner that the garrison of the main
position will not need to expose itself to the enemy’s artillery
fire as soon as his advanced troops appear.” Major Hoppenstedt
believes that this can be attained, in hill positions, by
conducting the fire fight, at long and medium ranges, from
positions in rear, the defender moving up into the main position,
specially prepared for this purpose, when the attacker
disappears in the defiladed spaces in front of it. The objection
to this method is that it necessitates too large a force to hold
the position.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>“In a protracted, obstinate fight, the defender’s trenches, exposed to
the combined hostile infantry and artillery fire, will finally become filled
with dead and wounded, and it will rarely be practicable to remove them.
The arrival of reinforcements will increase the confusion and the losses,
and the fighting energy of the troops will decrease with tremendous rapidity.
This is one of the greatest disadvantages of the defense as compared
with the attack and its constantly moving lines.</p>

<p>“In such cases, which will be typical at points where the attacker intends
to penetrate the line, it may be a real act of salvation for the
defender’s firing line to rush to the front.</p>

<p>“In fighting at short ranges, especially just before the assailant makes
his assault, such a rush to the front on the part of the defender’s line,
may be a good move for another reason. As is well known, the attacker’s
artillery must change targets when its infantry arrives within a certain
distance of the defender’s position. The Germans (par. 446 I. D. R.)
fix this point at 300 m. from the enemy, and the French, whose guns have
a flatter trajectory, fix it at 500 m. In attacking a hill position, when the
fire is well observed, the distance of this point from the position will be
considerably greater.</p>

<p>“But, no matter where the actual location of this point may be,
skillful infantry will start its assault very close to the point fixed by the
regulations, and never beyond it, so as to avoid interfering with the fire
of its artillery. Under such circumstances, it may be a skillful move for
a defender who is still full of fight, to decrease the distance which separates
him from the hostile infantry, in order that, by so doing, he may
escape from the hostile artillery fire and from the smoke which obscures
his vision. If he finds cover farther to the front, so much the better,
for he will then have that much of an advantage over the attacker.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page425">[425]</span></p>

<p>The weakness of most defensive positions lies in the danger
of a sudden attack being directed against a flank. The assailant
will endeavor to avoid making an attack against the front of
a position prepared for defense, when such an attack has small
chances of succeeding, and seek the decision by attacking a
flank, where conditions are, to a certain extent at least, equalized.
The danger of a flank attack increases with the length
of the defensive line. It is by no means a good move to prolong
the threatened wing (French VIth Army Corps at St. Privat)
for the purpose of warding off an envelopment. The power
of extension is bound to reach a limit sooner or later, and
the wing attacked will then be so weak and attenuated that
it will not be capable of offering serious resistance.</p>

<p>To ward off an employment by refusing a flank likewise
promises little success. The enemy’s superiority of fire will
make itself felt, first of all, at the salient thus formed (see
<a href="#Page357">p. 357</a> supra), and his convergent artillery and infantry fire,
which may even enfilade parts of the line, will paralyze all
tactical movements of the defender at this point.</p>

<p>By prolonging the line and by refusing a flank, we only
postpone the decision a little while, but cannot effectively cope
with an envelopment. This must be accomplished in a different
manner.</p>

<p>The best scheme would be to flank the enemy’s enveloping
force by posting an echelon in a suitable position, or to bring
about a decision by employing the reserve offensively. However,
for carrying out these measures, more time is required
than for merely refusing a flank. Time may be gained by
making an extensive reconnaissance on the flanks with strong
detachments, and by occupying supporting points lying on the
flanks, which the enemy would have to take before he could
think of attacking the main position.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In employing machine guns in defense, it should be borne
in mind that they are unsuited for carrying on protracted fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page426">[426]</span>
fights, and that the mobility of the machine gun batteries
cannot be utilized when, from the very start, they are assigned
a section to defend.</p>

<p>In general, it will be advisable in defense to keep the
machine guns at first with the reserve, and to employ them,
when necessary, to reinforce the defensive line at threatened
points, to prevent envelopment, to repulse an assault, or to
participate in an offensive movement.</p>

<p>This does not preclude their coming into action at the
very opening of an engagement, for instance, where it is necessary
to command important avenues of approach.</p>

<p>When a withdrawal under cover is assured, it will also be
possible to post machine gun batteries in such a manner, in
front or on a flank of the main position, that they can bring a
sudden fire to bear on the area in which the opponent will in
all probability post his artillery.</p>

<p>Machine gun fire may sometimes be employed to sweep
defiladed spaces in front of the defensive line.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the direction of the hostile attack is known, the occupation
of the position should not be longer deferred. It is always
risky to occupy the position in the face of hostile batteries,
especially as the fire of the defender’s guns is masked by the
skirmishers moving forward. If the defender can manage to
give the attacker the impression that the position is still unoccupied,
perhaps thereby inducing him to advance less cautiously,
and then surprise him with fire, a depressing moral effect far
exceeding the material success may be counted upon.<a id="FNanchor458" href="#Footnote458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The
firing line should be made so strong that the fire fight will
have a chance of succeeding. A gradual launching of the
troops should not be decided upon, as the losses are comparatively
insignificant in defense, and as it is important to develop<span class="pagenum" id="Page427">[427]</span>
a heavy fire so as to make it difficult for the enemy to gain the
fire superiority. The principles governing the moment for opening
fire have already been discussed (<a href="#Page147">pp. 147</a> and <a href="#Page154">154</a> supra).</p>

Colenso, on December 15th, 1899.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The enemy must be prevented from gaining the superiority
of fire. This should be accomplished by concentrating the fire
from a large number of rifles upon the parts of the enemy’s
force in motion. The defender should make the most of the
advantage which his preparedness gives him. The attacker’s
firing line with its supports forms the target. A departure
from this rule is in order, in the case of a French
assailant, as the latter places the bulk of his force in the
reserves and not in the firing line. It will frequently be practicable
for the defender to discontinue his fire and to take
cover when the assailant lies down and fires; but, while under
cover, everything should be prepared for resuming the fire
when the enemy rises to continue his advance (<a href="#Page156">p. 156</a> supra).</p>

<p>If it has been found impossible to prevent the enemy from
reaching the extreme limit of short ranges, the commander
must decide whether to continue the fight until a decision is
reached, or whether to break off the action.</p>

<p>When the opponent has entered the zone of short ranges,
it will be too late for the defender to retire, unless the terrain
in rear of the position is especially favorable, or other troops
can take a hand in the fight to cover the withdrawal. The
onrushing assailant is received with accelerated fire; the
defender fixes bayonets, determined to risk a fight at close
quarters. “The defender who does not fix bayonets is already
casting furtive glances towards the best line of retreat.”</p>

<p>While repulsing an assault, it would be a good plan for
the defender to step upon the rear wall of the trench so that
the latter would become an obstacle for the attacker. But this
scheme can only be employed when the troops are completely
in hand.</p>

<p>While the fire of the defender is increased to the utmost
intensity by the entrance into the fight of all the supports, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page428">[428]</span>
general reserve, which now takes a hand in the fight, seeks to
bring about the decision by advancing to attack. On arriving
close enough to assault, the attack reaches its most critical
stage, and even a counter-attack made by a comparatively
small force may turn the scale in favor of the defense.</p>

<p>In large engagements, the great power of resistance possessed
by well posted bodies of troops will often determine the
commander of the force on the defensive to contain the enemy
at one point with a strong defensive position, while at
the same time assuming the offensive at another. (This was
planned, but not carried out, at Dresden, in 1813, and at Troyes,
early in February, 1814; carried out with success, in Lee’s
operations around Richmond, during the latter part of June,
1862, and on the Lisaine in 1871; and miscarried on the Shaho,
because Kuropatkin made his decision dependent upon reports
in regard to the position of hostile reserves, which were non-existent
in reality). Whether the offensive should be assumed
while the enemy is still in the act of deploying,<a id="FNanchor460" href="#Footnote460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> or whether one
must be satisfied with assuming the offensive at the last
moment, is best determined by the relative strength of the opposing
forces. When battle-fronts are short this may still be
advantageous, but when the lines are long, a counter-attack can
affect only a small part of the assailant’s line, while the major
portion thereof successfully pushes the attack home. Then
the position and the day will be lost anyway, in spite of a local
success.</p>

<p>The initial measures taken assure freedom of action to the
defense, but the commander must not await exhaustive
messages. Prompt action is necessary, either for throwing
back the advanced troops of the assailant, or for striking a<span class="pagenum" id="Page429">[429]</span>
blow at the hostile flank. In the latter case, it is an advantage
if only weak reserves are struck, but hostile forces making
a turning movement may also be encountered, and the commander
will have to decide whether to deploy quickly and
assail the enemy, or whether to take his chances in a rencontre.<a id="FNanchor461" href="#Footnote461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>Even a success gained at a tactically unfavorable point
will make itself felt, if it is won early enough and if the
most is made of it. As a rule, tactical considerations determine
where the commander should launch his reserves for the
counter-attack.</p>

<p>The counter-attack here meant is an act of the commander
of the whole force; in bodies of troops acting as part of a larger
force and in numerically inferior forces, the warding off of
the flank attack remains almost always the only remedy.</p>

<p>“The general reserve should be posted at the point from
which it can best move forward, counter to the probable
direction of the hostile attack, while, at the same time, making
the most of the features of the ground. When only one flank
is secure, the general reserve is, as a rule, placed in echelon in
rear of the unprotected wing. When both flanks are in the
air, nothing remains but to place sufficient reserves in readiness
in rear of one flank to ward off a hostile envelopment, while
retaining as strong a force as possible in rear of the other for
the purpose of bringing about the decision. The echeloned
general reserve must have room for development, whether this
be for warding off a hostile envelopment or for making a
counter-attack.” (Par. 410 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>The general reserve should be posted in rear of the center
of the position only when the front is short and the situation
is not as yet cleared up. In this position it will frequently
be exposed to the fire directed against the first line, and its
entry into action will usually involve a loss of time. When
adequate information is available of the measures taken by the
opponent, or the nature of the ground compels him to direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page430">[430]</span>
his decisive attack against a wing, this alone determines the
position of the general reserve.</p>

<p>Since the counter-attack is to take the enemy by surprise,
the position of the general reserve must be concealed, and
precautions must be taken to keep hostile patrols in the dark,
as long as possible, in regard to its actual location. The ground
over which the general reserve is to advance should be free from
obstacles, so that the counter-attack can be made rapidly and
with uniformity.</p>

<p>Since the assailant will almost invariably endeavor to
direct his attack against a flank, the general reserve of the
defender should be posted at such a distance in rear of the
threatened wing that the troops composing it will be sheltered
to some extent from hostile fire. In order that the fully
deployed general reserve, when making a counter-attack, may
clear with its inner flank the outer flank of the line holding
the position, and not get into the latter’s zone of fire, a sufficient
interval must be left between the two. This interval
should increase with the size of the reserve. As a rule, the
counter-attack should be launched so as to produce the decision
when the assailant has arrived within assaulting distance of the
defender. This requires that the general reserve and the line
holding the position be separated by an interval of at least
200 m. In addition, the counter-attack must be so made that
it will actually strike the assailant in flank; and this it cannot
do unless the general reserve is posted sufficiently far to a flank.
The center of the reserve should be launched so as to strike not
only the flank of the enemy’s firing line, but that of his supports
as well. If the general reserve is posted too near the first
line, there is danger of it being enveloped together with the
first line, and committed to purely defensive action (refusing
a flank). On the other hand, if it is posted too far to a flank,
its timely entry into action is not absolutely assured; the
assailant may turn against it, cut it off from the defensive
position, and defeat it in detail. The farther the general
reserve is off to a flank, the more effectively will it strike the<span class="pagenum" id="Page431">[431]</span>
enemy in flank, but it will be correspondingly more difficult to
conceal it. The necessity of pushing the general reserve far to
a flank decreases, as the scope of the attacker’s envelopment
of the defensive line increases. It may frequently be to the
defender’s advantage to induce the assailant to make a far-reaching
envelopment, provided the line defending the position
is not placed in an unfavorable tactical situation by so doing.
Since the attacker will probably have detachments echeloned
in rear of his flank, the troops entrusted with the counter-attack
must similarly have an echelon in rear of their exposed
flank in order to protect themselves against a flank attack.</p>

<p>It is impossible to lay down a fixed, normal strength for
the reserve. This depends upon the strength of the position,
and the degree of resistance the intrenchments are capable of
rendering; but, in any case, the force intended for local defense
should be strong enough to compel the enemy to deploy completely,
and prevent his carrying the defenses before the
counter-attack is made. Large quantities of ammunition and
intrenchments capable of rendering effective resistance must
compensate for the shortage of men in warding off the enemy,
in order that the general reserve may be made as strong as
possible. The question, as to how thinly the position must be
occupied, and how strong the general reserve may be made,
can only be answered in each particular case. If the attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page432">[432]</span>
made by the general reserve is to produce any effect, it must
not be undertaken with too small a force, as it could then be
checked by weak detachments.</p>

<p>While the general reserve lies in waiting for the enemy, it
may <span class="nowrap">either&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. Remain in a preparatory position, in one or more
groups, and deploy during its forward movement; or</p>

<p>2. Take up the attack formation from the start.</p>

<p>The first method has the advantage, when the space
required is small, of permitting the general reserve to be concealed,
and allows changes to be made in the direction of
march and in the dispositions.</p>

<p>The second, although it enables the reserve to advance
promptly to the counter-attack, is rarely suitable, as the reserve
in combat formation is not so easily concealed, as it is more
difficult to make changes in the dispositions and the direction
of march, and as this formation seems only practicable for
making an advance in one direction&mdash;straight to the front.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance to know when the counter-attack
should be launched. In warding off the enemy by purely
frontal action, no special disadvantages result from prematurely
launching the general reserve; if it enters the action too
late, it will still be able to throw back the assailant who has
penetrated into the position. With the counter-attack it is different;
it must take place when the opponent is under the most
effective fire at short range. If the counter-attack is made
prematurely, especially when the reserves and flank echelons
of the attacker have not as yet been used up, the latter, while,
indeed, exposed to the most violent fire of the defender, will
be able to take counter-measures. In that case, two entirely
independent actions may result, and the counter-attack made
by the general reserve may be checked by the retained echelons
of the attacker and repulsed by their fire. When launched
prematurely, the counter-attack will not always repulse the
hostile attack; and when launched too late, it may perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page433">[433]</span>
still bring about the decision, or avert a defeat, but it will
never produce decisive results.</p>

<p>A counter-attack made after the attacker has penetrated
into the position, and while he is endeavoring to dislodge the
garrisons of such supporting points as still offer resistance,
reckons with the fact that the hitherto victorious assailant,
exhausted and in confusion, will not be a match for a well
aimed blow delivered by a considerable number of troops.
However, a defender will scarcely contemplate such an employment
of his general reserve; for him the important thing
is to repulse the attack in front of and not within the position.
Although military history presents comparatively numerous
instances of such <i>retours offensifs</i>, this may be explained by
the fact that the counter-attack was launched too late. The
weakness of the assailant is but momentary, and the most
must be made of this by advancing against him promptly by
the shortest line. But if the assailant has had time to re-form
and to bring up his batteries, it will usually be too late to
make a counter-attack.</p>

<p>The French regulations recommend a unique procedure,
which may be successful when employed against an opponent
not prepared to meet it. “Under certain circumstances,
counter-attacks may be combined with retreat maneuvers.
The advanced troops should bring the enemy to a standstill
with their fire and compel him to deploy. Then they
should break off the action without becoming involved in a
fight at close quarters. In this manner, the attacker is drawn
onto terrain reconnoitered beforehand, where fresh troops,
hidden up to the last moment, attack him impetuously under
favorable conditions at a time when he is tired and worn out
by a long movement.”</p>

<p>The most difficult thing about a counter-attack is to seize
the right moment for launching it. As it is impossible to
foretell how long it will take the enemy to arrive within
assaulting distance, no rule can be laid down as to the proper
moment for launching the counter-attack. The best plan
would be to screen the movements of the reserve, and, as the
attacking troops approach, to bring it gradually up to the
point from which it is to move forward. A commander requires
wide practical experience and great force of character
to judge the situation calmly and dispassionately, while fully
aware that launching the counter-attack either too soon or
too late may prejudice the result. There is always danger
that the suggestions which reach him from various quarters
may cause him to take half-measures. The stronger the
general reserve and the weaker the force holding the defenses,
the more numerous and urgent will be the requests for support;
and he will not find it easy to resist the temptation to
grant these requests and accordingly weaken the general
reserve, which is intended for offensive action.</p>

<p>We must now consider the question as to whether the
counter-attack should rely on fire action alone, or should
resort to the bayonet as well. The unexpected advance of a
large body of troops against a flank of the enemy will rarely<span class="pagenum" id="Page435">[435]</span>
fail to produce an effect. If the enemy does not yield to
fire, it is obvious that an assault will have to be made. A
counter-attack made unexpectedly is, as a rule, successful at
the start; but, if its commander follows up this initial success
when not supported by strong reserves, a reverse may take
place resulting in the defeat of the defender’s entire force.</p>

<p>So far we have only considered the counter-attack made
against the flank of an attacker, and against the front of
an enemy who has victoriously penetrated into a position.
The success of a counter-attack against the enemy’s flank
depends primarily on moral factors; besides, after protracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page436">[436]</span>
fighting, supports and reserves in rear of the flank are frequently
lacking, so that the attacker cannot quickly form an
adequate firing front towards a flank.<a id="FNanchor468" href="#Footnote468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>Theoretically, a frontal counter-attack, <i>i.e.</i>, one made
straight to the front from a position, while the assailant is
advancing to the assault on a broad front, ought to offer the
least chances of success, but military history proves the contrary
in those cases where the defender awaited the proper
moment. This moment arrives when the defender clearly
perceives that the enormous losses suffered by the attacker
begin to impair the morale of his remaining men. This
becomes apparent through a slackening in the attack, through
an uncertainty of movement, and, finally, through hesitation,
the latter being usually preceded by wavering.<a id="FNanchor469" href="#Footnote469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote469" href="#FNanchor469" class="label">[469]</a> “The defender will only be able to make a frontal counter-attack from his

lead to the loss of the position.” (Par. 414 German I. D. R.).</p>

<p>The moral effect of a determined counter-attack with

be great. Meckel says<a id="FNanchor470" href="#Footnote470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>: “Here likewise, it is of
the greatest importance to bring up the supports promptly, so
as to increase the volume of fire to the utmost and to produce
that superiority which quite naturally resolves itself into an
offensive movement. The defender who does not fix bayonets
is already casting furtive glances towards the best line of
retreat.”</p>

<p>Although such counter-attacks, directed against the strong
firing line of the attacker and unsupported by the defender’s
fire, were frequently successful in war, this was due to the
moral effect produced on the attacker by the sudden and
unexpected onset of a long line of infantry. Troops thus
unexpectedly attacked, and, in addition, deprived of the support
of their own artillery, almost invariably lost their heads.
However, if the attacker is prepared for such an event,
remains cool, meets the counter-attack of the defender with a
powerful fire at short ranges, and brings up his supports, in
order to follow up the effect of his fire with an offensive
movement, there can be no doubt as to the result.<a id="FNanchor472" href="#Footnote472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a></p>

line of infantry, and at Kesselsdorf a charge made by the Bonin Dragoons finally
turned the scale in favor of the assailant.</p>

<p>Such a counter-attack, however, is only possible when the
defender still has strong, intact reserves at his disposal, which
he has kept in readiness in the closest proximity to the firing

has no choice but to make a frontal counter-attack, unless
offensive action is to be dispensed with altogether.</p>

were very frequently made. When undertaken with

<h5>Provisions of Various Regulations.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>Austria-Hungary.</b> If a counter-attack is contemplated, the commander
should resist every temptation to employ parts of the general
reserve for other purposes than for carrying out that attack. In this case,
the general reserve should be placed in readiness so that, while the opponent
advances within the decisive zone, it can quickly deploy and carry out
the counter-attack with determination by directing a powerful fire against
the flank of the enemy. Freedom of movement on one flank is absolutely
essential to the execution of the counter-attack. Local frontal counter-attacks
are to be avoided; the enemy is to be annihilated by fire.</p>

<p>When it is not contemplated to make a counter-attack with the general
reserve, the latter is to be employed either for directly reinforcing the
troops in one of the sections, or for engaging the hostile troops making
an enveloping attack on the position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page439">[439]</span></p>

<p><b>France.</b> The regulations make a distinction between counter-attack
(<i>contre attaque</i>) and offensive return (<i>retour offensif</i>). A counter-attack
is made by the reserve before the enemy penetrates into the energetically
defended supporting points. In contrast herewith, every attempt
to retake a captured position is called an offensive return.</p>

<p>A counter-attack with troops of the second line is to be made as soon
as the assailant presses the fighting line too closely. A powerful and
suddenly executed counter-attack, supported by the fire of the first line,
will, at the very least, check the enemy until the fighting line has had time
to recover.</p>

<p>Occasionally, it may be advantageous not to await the crisis, but to
force the assailant to deploy by directing a heavy fire upon him, then to
break off the action, inducing the enemy to press on, in order to draw
him, by this means, onto previously selected and reconnoitered terrain,
where he is suddenly attacked in flank by fresh troops. Military history
shows that this very procedure has frequently been successful. “If the
attacker presses forward too hastily and if he threatens to carry the
defender’s position, fresh troops, which have been assembled in a place
sheltered from view, attack him energetically, while the troops already
engaged increase the intensity of their fire. This powerful and energetic
counter-attack produces confusion in the enemy’s ranks and compels him
to retire, or at least to discontinue his forward movement until he has
had time to recover.”</p>

<p>“The same activity, the same determination to maneuver, must prevail
everywhere. Every mistake and every weakness of the enemy must
be quickly perceived and promptly utilized. The troops in the counter-attack
should move forward without hesitation and regardless of the cost
When such a forward movement has to be discontinued, the commander
must decide where it shall cease. The efforts of all should be directed
toward one object, that of tiring and demoralizing the enemy by constant
counter-attacks, until the moment arrives when the commander must order
the offensive to be assumed.”</p>

<p><b>England.</b> The counter-attack may be made either by the garrison
of the firing trenches, as a frontal counter movement, or by the general
reserve, accompanied by artillery and cavalry, as a decisive counter-attack.
The moment when the attacker has used up his reserves and is
about to assault is generally considered as the most propitious for making
the counter-attack.</p>

<p><b>Japan.</b> The Japanese entertain the same views as the Germans.
“The better the position, the location and construction of the intrenchments,
and the distribution of troops, the greater the number of men that
can be saved in garrisoning the position, and the stronger the general
reserve available for an offensive movement. By this means the chances
of victory are increased. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Frequently there is danger that the
defender will be committed to purely passive defense, and that freedom
of action will be lost. Therefore, when the proper moment arrives, the
decisive counter-attack should be made.”</p>

<p>A retreat under effective hostile fire means annihilation;
only the presence of cover immediately in rear of the fighting
line should induce a commander to come to the weighty
decision of reaching it by running. (Russia). On account
of the great range of modern weapons, defeated troops, on
open ground, cannot escape from fire by running.<a id="FNanchor478" href="#Footnote478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> No rules
can be laid down in regulations as to the conduct of a retreat
after a defeat. As a rule, further resistance is no longer
possible; neither is it practicable to leave some troops in
position to cover the retreat. The defeated force must retire
in a direction perpendicular to the front of the enemy,<a id="FNanchor479" href="#Footnote479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> and
cannot re-form until the fire of the opponent ceases or at
least abates. (Par. 428 German I. D. R.). Artillery which
is moved to the rear at a timely moment, and all available
cavalry should cover the retreat of the infantry, so as to prevent
the hostile cavalry from making the most of its opportunities
for effective action.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote478" href="#FNanchor478" class="label">[478]</a> Furthermore, the danger of panic should not be underestimated. See

(Wörth). This skirmish line was running to the rear toward a rallying position
and the panic was produced by the command “To the rear. Double Time!

a mounted field officer. Major v. Below.</p>

<p>To order a retreat at the right moment requires military
instinct; rules cannot be laid down in regard to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page441">[441]</span></p>

<p>“Troops which, while engaged with the enemy, are
either withdrawn by order or defeated, can no longer choose
their line of retreat. If the enemy pursues, they must retire
perpendicularly to their former front, without changing formation,
and need a force on which they can rally in order to
prepare for renewed resistance. From this it follows that a
systematic retreat can only be carried out when the force
still has some distribution in depth. It would be wrong however,
for a force intended for decisive action to retain a
reserve for covering the retreat instead of employing it for
the purpose of gaining the victory.”</p>

<p>To break off the action by systematically relieving the
troops engaged with the enemy,<a id="FNanchor480" href="#Footnote480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> is only possible if the force
still has reserves available, if cavalry and artillery are in a
position to take a hand in the fight, or if the troops that have
been withdrawn are sheltered from the enemy’s fire by
features of the ground&mdash;all of which depends in many cases
on chance.</p>

<p>It is much more difficult to break off an action in defense
than in attack, as in the former case, the assailant approaches
closer with every moment. This brings up the question, as
to whether it would not be better for the defender to hold
out until darkness sets in than expose his troops to the incalculable
results of a retreat under fire. When the assailant
has once entered the zone of short ranges, the defender will
no longer be able to effect a systematic retreat. If the
defender has used up all his reserves, the withdrawal should
be begun at the point where the enemy is not pressing his
attack, or where he has been unable to gain a superiority of
fire. When a withdrawal is made, the whole local front
should retire at once and simultaneously; it would be a mistake
to reduce gradually the strength of the units engaged,
for this would only give the enemy an opportunity to annihilate
completely the remaining parts. If a company cannot
maintain its position, a platoon certainly could not do so.</p>

<p>As soon as the commander decides to break off the
action, the reserve, if one is still available, should be sent to
the rear to take up a rallying position, which should be so
situated that it can make its influence felt as soon as the
main position is evacuated. As every defeated force, or
one that is withdrawn by order, retires straight to the rear,
the rallying position, in order to allow the troops holding it
to fire effectively, must be located as far as possible to a
flank of the line of retreat. If the outer flank of the position
can be advanced, fire may be opened at an earlier moment,
but this will only be practicable in minor engagements. The
distance of the rallying position from the main defensive position
should be such as to compel the enemy to advance again
under fire, and prevent his carrying both the main defensive
position and the rallying position at one rush. On the other
hand, the rallying position should not be so far to the rear
that the retreating troops may be annihilated before they
enter its effective zone. However, as the troops in the rallying
position are also to effect a withdrawal, it is not a good
plan for them to engage the enemy from the start at too
short a range. “It is most desirable when artillery and
machine guns supported by cavalry suffice for this purpose,
while the infantry uninterruptedly continues its retreat. The
mounted arms follow later at an increased gait.” (Par. 429
German I. D. R.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page443">[443]</span></p>

<p>The rallying position should be occupied in time, so that
all dispositions for holding it can be made calmly and without
precipitation. A powerful fire at mid and long ranges
is requisite to prevent the enemy from reaching decisive
ranges. The firing line should, therefore, be strong and the
supports weak. If a reserve is still available, it is at once
sent back into a second rallying position, to cover the withdrawal
of the troops occupying the first rallying position. A
free field of fire down to the shortest ranges is not necessary.
If the position is on elevated ground, the firing line should
be posted so far in rear of the crest that, while its fire can
still sweep the ground at mid ranges, and perhaps at the
extreme limit of short ranges, the skirmishers, on retiring,
will be sheltered as soon as possible. Fire should be opened
as soon as possible, in order to retard the enemy’s advance.</p>

<p>The troops holding a rallying position should delay the
enemy’s advance long enough to give the retiring force ample
time and room to re-form, so that it can effect its retreat in
good order. When this has been accomplished, the troops
occupying the rallying position retire, unless there is hope
that fresh troops may bring about a change in the state of
affairs. As a rule, a second rallying position will be necessary,
but it would be a mistake to halt in every seemingly
favorable position. When a retreat has once been decided
upon, it is generally necessary to get away from the enemy
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>“The commander must conduct the combat attending a
retreat according to a well-ordered plan. He must indicate
where the rallying position is to be, what troops are to
occupy it, and assign march directions to the different columns.
Only after he has given these orders and has assured
himself that they will be executed, does he leave the battlefield,
in order to meet his troops soon thereafter with new
orders.<a id="FNanchor481" href="#Footnote481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
The rest is the business of subordinate leaders.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page444">[444]</span>
(Par. 432 German I. D. R.). The latter remain with their
organizations for the purpose of maintaining order and
cohesion. (Par. 297 German I. D. R.). Adjutants and
officers detailed to receive orders should be sent to the rear
ahead of the troops.<a id="FNanchor482" href="#Footnote482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">XIII. CONTAINING ACTIONS.</h3>

</div><!--chapter-->

<h4>THE DELAYING ACTION AND THE HOLDING
ATTACK.</h4>

<p>Since the attacker will invariably seek to overpower the
defender, and the latter will endeavor to prevent this by
force of arms, it is obvious that an enemy can be “delayed”
or “held” only when he permits this to be done. It is
difficult to conduct a delaying action or a holding attack,
because our training, which is based on offensive action,
causes subordinate leaders to follow up every little advantage.
In delaying actions, the defensive, and in holding
attacks, the offensive intention predominates. The latter
may consist of merely threatening the enemy with an attack,
or of seriously engaging him. (Par. 392 German I. D. R.).
Both the delaying action and the holding attack aim at
deceiving the enemy.<a id="FNanchor483" href="#Footnote483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Accordingly, the characteristic features
of these combats are great frontage, large expenditure of
ammunition, and long range fire, but, at the same time, few
rifles, in order to deceive the enemy as to the strength of
our force. In both combats, troops require considerable distribution
in depth. The object of a delaying action is to
gain time until the troops in rear can deploy, neighboring
columns can come up, or a turning movement can become
effective. (Par. 417 German I. D. R.). Troops fighting a
delaying action require considerable distribution in depth so
that they can effect a withdrawal. Distribution in depth is<span class="pagenum" id="Page446">[446]</span>
still more necessary in a holding attack,<a id="FNanchor484" href="#Footnote484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> in order that the
troops may be able to repulse a counter-attack made by the
enemy, or, by attacking him energetically, prevent his withdrawing.
A force fighting a delaying action should keep its
supports far to the rear, while a force charged with holding
the enemy should keep them in close proximity. By properly
employing his artillery, the commander can best exercise an
influence on the course of the combat. (Par. 419 German
I. D. R.). Since a delaying action is to be fought at long
ranges, a field of fire is only required at those ranges; defiladed
spaces in the foreground may frequently be a positive
advantage. The fire fight is kept up only so long as it is
necessary to keep the enemy at a distance. In a holding
attack, it will not be proper to keep up a continuous fire;
the violent fire breaking forth from time to time must teach
the defender that a force is lying in waiting opposite him,
ready to rush forward at a moment’s notice.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote483" href="#FNanchor483" class="label">[483]</a> This is still
more pronounced In demonstrations. (<cite>Taktik</cite>, V, p. 11).
“Feints are to deceive the enemy as to our intentions, but they may consist of
offensive action. The regulations do not lay down specific rules either for
them or for other more rare methods of combat; accordingly, their conduct will
vary with the situation.” (Par. 420, German I. D. R.).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote484" href="#FNanchor484" class="label">[484]</a> <cite>Taktik</cite>, V, p. 161.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The object of threatening with an attack may frequently
be accomplished by engaging the enemy with several detachments
which are separated by intervals. (Par. 288 German
I. D. R.). The negative object of preventing the enemy
from withdrawing may be accomplished with a weak force;
the positive object of compelling the enemy to use up his
reserves in the early stages of the fight and at a less decisive
point, requires that lie be engaged with a stronger force. A
determined commander will not allow himself to be held by
demonstrations. The manner in which the Vth Army Corps
forced the French to bring up their reserves into the first
line at Wörth, is worthy of imitation.</p>

<p>The size of the group charged with holding the enemy
depends upon the extent of front to be covered and the
probable duration of the combat. The conduct of such a
force will vary considerably, depending upon the distance
to the point where the decisive action is to be fought. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page447">[447]</span>
the holding force is close to this point, it should engage the
enemy energetically.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>England.</b> The holding attack is to deceive the enemy as to the direction
in which the main attack will be made, and, when the crisis of the
action approaches, prevent his withdrawing troops from those parts of his
front which are only threatened and opposing the decisive attack with
nearly his entire force. Accordingly, the troops making the holding attack
should act vigorously, as soon as the attack develops, and be in readiness
to transform their demonstration instantly into a real attack.</p>

1903.<a id="FNanchor485" href="#Footnote485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote485" href="#FNanchor485" class="label">[485]</a> The various provisions of the German and Austrian Infantry Drill Regulations
are skillfully compared by Major-General <span class="smcap">Regenspursky v. Regeny</span>,

für die k. k. Fusztruppen vom Jahre 1903. Ein Vergleich mit dem
deutschen Reglement 1906</cite>. (<cite>Militär-Wochenblatt</cite>, 1906, Nos. 7 and 8).</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h5>ATTACK.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>Both the rencontre and the attack on a position prepared for defense
are considered. The regulations in regard to the rencontre have been
revised, so as to permit a commander to launch the battalions of his main
body directly from route column, or to concentrate his main body farther
to the rear, while his advance guard stands on the defensive. The <b>attack
on a position prepared for defense</b>, even after the attacker’s artillery has
succeeded in paving the way for its infantry, consists of a laborious advance
from one firing position to another. The question as to whether an attack
is feasible without the support of artillery fire, is answered to the effect
that it will, as a rule, be a difficult undertaking, unless the artillery has
sufficiently silenced the batteries of the defender. The regulations divide
the attack into two clearly defined phases, viz., the advance to the decisive
firing position (the main firing position), and the decisive action.</p>

<p>The provisions of the regulations coincide very nearly with the views
considered sound in Germany, and therefore an attempt will here merely
be made to point out several differences. The combat formation necessary
for the decisive stage of the action is taken up during the preparatory stage,
so that, when the forward movement commences, the troops need only
move straight to the front. (Par. 568). In a division, by appropriately
combining “tactical units”, echelons are formed, whose strength depends
upon the purpose of the combat, the information of the enemy, and the
relation of the division to other bodies of troops. (Pars. 533, 540 and 541).
Rules for the employment of thin or dense firing lines are not given.
“The attacker should advance impetuously to the point where he can employ
his rifles effectively,” (Par. 582).</p>

<p>“In an attack, everything should be done to get within effective range
of the opponent before fire is opened by the whole line.” (Par. 323).
When acting as part of a larger force, a platoon may open fire independently,
if it suddenly encounters the enemy or if it finds a good opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page449">[449]</span>
for firing which the company commander has overlooked. (Par. 338).
Unless the battalion commander has reserved to himself the right of
designating the moment for opening fire, the company commanders direct
when fire shall be opened, and conduct the fire fight at mid and short
ranges. At long ranges, the battalion commander designates the companies
that are to fire.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of fire.</b> Fire at will and volley fire are employed. As a rule,
volleys are only used when the troops are in close order, but may also be
used in skirmish line to test the range. According to par. 331, the rate
of fire may be accelerated, and in pars. 327 and 686, fire surprises are
authorized.</p>

<p>When exposed to effective fire, the firing line is to <b>advance by rushes</b>.
These are to be made by alternate units moving forward, supported by the
fire of those remaining behind. Rushes are only in exceptional cases to
be made by units smaller than a platoon. “The length of the rushes
depends upon the character of the ground and the tactical situation, as
well as upon the physical condition of the men. They serve as an expedient
for reaching the next firing position.” (Par. 313).</p>

<p>Movements under effective hostile fire may sometimes be made by
<b>crawling</b>. This is considered especially useful in rectifying alignments.
(Par. 196).</p>

<p>For <b>envelopment</b>, see <a href="#Page362">p. 362</a> supra.</p>

<p>For the <b>use of the spade in attack</b>, see <a href="#Page393">p. 393</a> supra.</p>

<p><b>Assault.</b> “The close approach of a long firing line to an enemy who
occupies a good position, may well pass as a proof of the assailant’s
superiority. Nevertheless, this does not, under all circumstances, furnish
assurance that a forward movement for the purpose of penetrating the
hostile position will now succeed; a premature assault may still result in
disaster.</p>

<p>“As long as the conduct of the opponent does not show clear indications
that his fire power is crippled, nothing remains for the attacker
but to continue the fight for the superiority of fire. In doing this, the
commander should not hesitate to put in his last man if necessary. The
assault&mdash;in case the enemy still offers resistance&mdash;should not be made
until the attack has been pushed sufficiently close to the enemy’s position,
and the power of resistance of the enemy is palpably broken.</p>

<p>“It is immaterial what formations are taken up for this closing act
of the combat, as it should be the natural culmination of a situation strained
to the utmost. The troops must understand that there is no longer any
chance to go back; that on the contrary, at this moment, honor and
salvation lie wholly in moving to the front.</p>

<p>“When the assault has once begun, the hostile position should be
carried in one rush. Any hesitation or halting, at this critical stage of
the action, may nullify the previous success, and must therefore be quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page450">[450]</span>
overcome by the reserves, if any are still available, taking a hand in the
fight.” (Pars. 590-592).</p>

<p>The decision to assault may emanate either from the firing line, from
the commander of the whole force, or from the commander of one of the
units. If the decision emanates from the firing line, all the troops are to
conform to the movement of that line. The following provision, which
applies even to a company acting alone, differs from the German regulations,
viz., “During the assault, a part of the assailant’s force should,
whenever practicable, continue its fire and direct it upon any hostile
reserves that may appear.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<h5>DEFENSE.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The regulations governing the <b>defense seeking a decision</b> differ
but little from the views entertained in Germany. The actual work of
preparing a position for defense is not to commence until the direction
in which the enemy is going to make his attack is known. The assailant
is to be prevented, as far as possible, from obtaining information of the
position and the measures taken for strengthening it. This is to be
accomplished by pushing small detachments to the front to hamper the
enemy’s advance.</p>

<p>In the past, <b>advanced positions</b> were decidedly opposed by the Austrians,
but at present their use is recommended in cases where time is
to be gained or the enemy is to be deceived, or where fire from such
positions would inflict considerable losses on the enemy. However, the
regulations seek to obviate the danger of the principal fight taking place in
the advanced position instead of in the main position, by adding: “But such
a measure should not cause the commander to swerve from the firm
determination to carry out his original intention.”</p>

<p>The tremendously increased fire power of infantry is to make it
possible to hold the front with a comparatively weak force, while the
remaining troops are concentrated as a reserve with which the actual
decision is to be brought about. The commander should resist every
temptation to use the general reserve for other purposes than for carrying
out the <b>counter-attack</b>, which should be ordered when the assailant is
under the most effective fire of the position. The general reserve should
then be quickly deployed and should make its attack with determination,
by directing a violent fire against the flank of the enemy. Local frontal
counter-attacks are to be avoided. The garrison is only charged with
the task of annihilating the enemy with its fire, which should be increased
to the utmost intensity.</p>

<h6>ATTACK.</h6>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The peculiar character of the probable Italian theater of war in
Upper Italy, with its numerous forests of tall timber, and its many defiles,
causes special attention to be paid to the offensive.<a id="FNanchor487" href="#Footnote487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> The regulations
emphasize the necessity of the coöperation of infantry and artillery.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote487" href="#FNanchor487" class="label">[487]</a> Unless otherwise ordered, the advance guard advances against the hostile
forces which it encounters in its march, whether its action be to determine,
as quickly as possible, the strength of the opponent and to save its main
body from an unnecessary delay, or whether it be to deceive the opponent as
to the location of its own forces, or, in certain cases, to make the most of a
surprise. (Par. 37).</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>Although the platoons intended for the firing line are brought up
in close order formation, the actual combat formation is not taken up
until the situation makes this necessary; but, in any case, the leading
element is to enter the zone of hostile fire in a deployed formation. To
neutralize the mixing of units as much as possible as the action progresses,
the firing line is formed into groups separated by intervals of 4-5 paces,
although this increases the casualties. These intervals may be increased,
when required, to 10 paces. (Intervals between skirmishers in the firing
line are usually at least 15 cm., otherwise 3 paces). The firing line is to
advance until increased casualties force it to open fire.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of fire.</b> Only fire at will is employed. (This is also used when
the troops are in close order and formed in four ranks). The battalion
commander in the first line directs that fire be opened, as soon as it is
certain that a good effect can be produced. When two targets appear, the
fire is to be directed upon the one promising the best results (<i>i.e.</i>, not
necessarily the one that is tactically most important). “In order that the
intensity of the fire may correspond to the requirements of the tactical
situation existing at the moment, officers, by reason of their tactical training,
should be able to state approximately how many rounds are necessary
to produce the desired effect, the range, degree of visibility and character
of the target, the nature of the terrain and of their position, as well as
the physical condition and morale of their men being given. From these<span class="pagenum" id="Page452">[452]</span>
estimates may be deduced how many rifles must be employed in order to
bring about a decisive result in the shortest possible time.”</p>

<p>The <b>advance by rushes</b> may be made either at a walk or at a run,
but the regulations do not prescribe in detail how it shall be conducted.
The following points are considered especially important: The time for
making a rush, its length, and whether it should be made by a whole
unit simultaneously or in echelon. All this depends upon various circumstances,
which the leader, alter due consideration of the terrain and
the hostile fire, as well as of the physical condition and morale of his
men, is to judge in each particular case. In doing this, he is to bear in
mind that the rush must be made as unobserved by the enemy as possible,
so that the latter cannot direct his lire upon the advancing unit.</p>

<p>The rushes are to be made first by those parts of the firing line which
are favored by the terrain and which have gained a superiority of fire over
the hostile troops immediately opposed to them. Units which could
only advance by rushes at the cost of considerable and useless losses,
are to wait until the neighboring units have pushed ahead, support these
with their fire, and then advance in turn under cover of the fire of the
others.</p>

<p>As a general rule, so long as the hostile fire permits, rushes are to
be made by entire companies, or at least by whole platoons. The length
of the rushes and whether they are made at a walk or at a run, depends
upon the nature of the terrain. Upon completing a rush, fire is to be
opened at once.</p>

<p>When the intensity of the hostile fire increases, or after the organizations
have become mixed, rushes can no longer be made by entire units but
only by squads or like fractions. These leave the firing line and endeavor to
reach the next cover at a rapid run. or, if cover be lacking, throw themselves
down in order to open fire again at the shorter range thus gained.
As a rule, the leading echelons open fire at once from their new positions,
so as to facilitate the advance of the others, unless special circumstances
make it advisable to delay the firing until all the other units have reached
a good position and are able to direct an effective fire upon the enemy.</p>

<p>At short ranges, in covered terrain, or on ground swept by hostile
fire, the best way to avoid losses is to advance in small groups consisting
of several skirmishers. During each rush, the adjoining flanks of neighboring
units cease firing, so as not to injure the men of the advancing
unit. Platoon and company commanders hurry ahead, while squad leaders
see that all of the men move forward.</p>

<p>Standing crops frequently enable the echelons in rear to follow the
firing line in closer order, and may even permit supports, which are to
carry that line forward, to come up in that formation.</p>

<p>The <b>assault</b> is to be made either in close or extended order to the
tune of the Royal March and with loud cheers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page453">[453]</span></p>

<p>The regulations assume, however, that the superiority of fire, gained
by the mutual coöperation of infantry and artillery and by the participation
of the reserves, will induce the opponent to retreat. When engaged with
an obstinate opponent, who remains in his position, only a part of the
leading line is to be launched against certain sections (<i>tratti</i>) of the
defensive position, while other parts, by means of rapid fire, prevent the
enemy from supporting the threatened sections. In conjunction with this
frequently emphasized scheme of penetrating several specially important
sections of the hostile position, the regulations express the view&mdash;by no
means generally considered sound-that the capture of several judiciously
chosen points will force the enemy to retreat.</p>

<p>The assault is, as a rule, to be made by order of the commander of the
whole force. The short burst of rapid fire preceding the assault is
suddenly terminated by the command “attention” (<i>attenti</i>), and at the
command “to the assault” (<i>per l’assalto</i>), the men throw themselves with
loud cheers, accompanied by the sounding of trumpets and the beating
of drums, upon the enemy. When a unit has already gotten so close to the
enemy that further waiting would be useless, it advances to the assault,
after getting permission therefor, or, otherwise, on its own responsibility.
All the rest of the troops are to join in this movement.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<h5>DEFENSE.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>So long as it is not definitely known in which direction the enemy
will approach, the position is to be occupied with as weak a force as
possible. The decision is to be brought about by a <b>counter-attack</b>. Long
range fire is only considered proper on broad stretches of open terrain
devoid of cover; and, in general, fire is not to be opened until the enemy
arrives at short ranges. As soon as fire is opened, all the supports are
to be in the firing line. A counter-attack is undertaken by the first line
only in exceptional cases.</p>

<h4>THE FRENCH DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1904.</h4>

<h5>ATTACK.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>Both the French and the German regulations show a decided preference
for the offensive, and both have eliminated all rules which might
produce normal formations. There is an unmistakable inclination towards
shock tactics in the French regulations, although the term “shock troops”
has been replaced by “maneuvering troops”. “The forward movement
alone is decisive and irresistible.... The fire is the element that
executes”. The habit of looking upon the German army as a probable
opponent leads the French to provide for reconnaissance with mixed detachments.
The regulations do not touch upon the tactics of the rencontre,
and prescribe a more cautious conduct for the advance guard than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page454">[454]</span>
German regulations.<a id="FNanchor488" href="#Footnote488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> The advance guard is to occupy supporting points,
under cover of which the main body can deploy, and to complete the
reconnaissance by its fight. The necessity of infantry detachments completing
the reconnaissance made by the cavalry is particularly emphasized.</p>

<p>Another difference between the two regulations considered lies in
the manner of making use of the cover afforded by the ground. The
danger of going too far in this direction is guarded against in the German
regulations by assigning combat sections to the various units. The French
regulations prescribe a group formation of the several combat elements,
and a concentration at favorable points, while the plain devoid of cover
is left unoccupied. The center of gravity of a French attack does not
lie in the firing line&mdash;the fight for the superiority of fire is not mentioned&mdash;but
in maneuvering troops cautiously led after the firing line. The defender
is to be engaged all along the line and, when the weak points of his
position are recognized, the commander-in-chief is to give the order for
the assault.</p>

<p>This division of a force into a fire and a shock group causes the
French to prefer the echelon formation on general principles. A brigade
is formed as follows, for example: Two battalions of the 1st regiment in
the first line, which is followed at 400 m. by the third battalion (<i>troupe
d’entrainement</i>); the 2nd regiment follows at a like distance as a reserve.</p>

<p>The regulations divide the attack into the artillery and the infantry
preparation (<i>préparation</i>), the decisive action (<i>l’action décisive</i>), and the
completion (<i>l’achèvement</i>).</p>

<p><b>The artillery in the preparatory action.</b> The artillery is to endeavor
to silence the hostile artillery as quickly as possible, without, however, expending
more ammunition than is absolutely necessary.... The
commander is not to give the order for the attack until the preparation
is considered sufficient.</p>

<p>The troops are led forward over the terrain in a particularly careful
manner (see p. 208 supra), and are then concentrated in a sheltered
and protected place. Twelve mounted men (Reservists) are attached to
every infantry regiment for reconnaissance purposes. The manner in
which the French utilize the ground is typical. In this, widely separated
parts of the force may unexpectedly encounter a strong hostile firing line,
and may be defeated in detail.</p>

<p>The official regulations are supplemented by special regulations issued
in March 1907 for the army maneuvers by General Lacroix, formerly
commanding the VIIth Army Corps, and at present Vice President of the
Supreme War Council.</p>

<p><b>Assembly.</b> The division is assembled in division square (<i>carré de
division</i>), in which the brigades are in line or in echelon, the regiments in
line of double columns or in line of company columns, abreast or in
echelon. If a frontal attack is to be made, in which successive lines are
pushed forward without any attempt to envelop (in other words a pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page455">[455]</span>
frontal attack), the division is concentrated with the brigades abreast,
their regiments in echelon. If a flank attack is to be made, in which
the leading brigade must be protected by an echelon and a reserve ready for
any eventuality, the division is concentrated with the brigades in echelon,
their regiments abreast. The artillery is posted in section column near a
road in rear of the <i>carré</i>. The pioneer company is divided into four
parts, corresponding to the four heads of columns of the assembled
troops, for the purpose of removing obstacles and cutting passages during
the forward movement. The cavalry is pushed forward and the assembled
force is protected in all directions by outposts of infantry and cavalry.</p>

<p><b>Preparations for the advance in mass formation.</b> During the concentration,
mounted officers reconnoiter the covering features of the terrain
which are to be utilized during the advance of the massed division, and
later these officers act as guides.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<h6 class="french">Preparatory attack formation.</h6>

<div class="longquote">

<p><b>A. Pure frontal attack.</b> The leading regiment in each brigade is to
have two battalions in the firing line and supports, the third to be
echeloned in the rear of the outer flank. All of the battalions are to be
protected by infantry patrols and by a small detachment of cavalry. The
second regiment is to have one battalion echeloned in rear of the inner
flank of the leading regiment, and the divisional cavalry is to be held in
rear of the division, in readiness to advance to the right or the left.</p>

<p><b>B. Flank attack.</b> The two regiments of the leading brigade are to
furnish their own firing lines, supports, and reserves. The third regiment
is to be echeloned 500 m. in rear of the others, and the fourth regiment is to
form the general reserve. The cavalry is to reconnoiter on the outer
flank. In this case, as well as in a pure frontal attack, the artillery is to
take up a position from which it can support the attack. Drummers,
trumpeters, and bands, are to march with the general reserve. The regulations
state that it is absolutely essential for infantry units to be sheltered
from hostile observation during their forward movement, and that they
must remain under control of their leaders up to the last moment. Troops
are not to deploy until they enter terrain swept by the enemy’s fire. (According
to the decision of umpires at peace maneuvers, this would be at
5000 m.). It should be borne in mind that deployed troops cannot move
by a flank, but only straight to the front.</p>

<p>The forward movement, in which the terrain will invariably cause
lateral displacements of troops, is made from cover to cover, when necessary,
from one supporting point to another. No hard and fast rules
or normal formations are prescribed for this advance.</p>

<p>The advance is to be made as long as possible without firing a shot.
When this is no longer practicable, recourse is to be had to fire, as the only
means of making a further advance possible.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of fire.</b> Fire at will (<i>feu à volonté</i>), principally used at short
ranges, for the purpose of retarding the enemy’s advance; fire with
counted cartridges (<i>feu à cartouches comptées</i>), the number being given<span class="pagenum" id="Page456">[456]</span>
(this is the fire usually employed); magazine fire (<i>feu à répétition</i>); and
the fire of specially designated marksmen. Volley fire has been again
prescribed. “Bursts of fire” (<i>rafales</i>) are typical of French fire tactics.
(See <a href="#Page164">p. 164</a> supra).</p>

<p>After fire has been opened, the advance is to be made by rushes, but
the regulations do not prescribe how these shall be made.</p>

<p>The regulations contain a very realistic description of the infantry
combat with its fluctuations, isolated attacks, and reverses. They emphasize
that all must be animated by a desire to carry forward, by means
of reinforcements, any troops that may have been checked. At the
point where an advance is absolutely impossible, as many hostile troops
as possible are to be held fast by an energetic fire fight, while the troops in
the decisive attack engage the enemy and advance impetuously.</p>

<p>A series of attacks is to be made from the various covering features all
along the line. These, made with the impetuosity inculcated by the regulations,
are very apt to fail prematurely. This is particularly likely to
happen because some of the troops will fall behind, while others are able
to push ahead more rapidly. These attacks are to destroy the power of
resistance of the enemy and to exhaust him physically. The leading units
are to cover with their fire the advance of those who are less favored by
the terrain.<a id="FNanchor489" href="#Footnote489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> During peace maneuvers, the fight now comes to a standstill
at a range of 600 to 800 m.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote489" href="#FNanchor489" class="label">[489]</a> According to
<span class="smcap">Dencausse</span>, in <cite>Journal des Sciences Militaires</cite>, 1906, and
November-December number 1907, the infantry should endeavor to approach
within 700-800 m. of the enemy’s position without firing a shot.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>The supports (<i>renforts</i>) follow in a similar manner, ready to move
up into the firing line at the first signal to that effect, or independently
in case the situation requires it. Their entry into action is in a general
way determined by the commander of the whole force. They are to
augment the fire power of the firing line or to carry it forward. The
efforts of all are to be directed toward constantly keeping up the advance.</p>

<p>At some points, the troops, when reinforced by their supports, will
be able to attack some of the enemy’s supporting points, and to effect a
lodgment on the ground captured. At other points the attacking group will
be too weak to push the attack home. In such a case, the troops are to
effect a lodgment on the terrain (<i>s’accrochent sur le sol</i>) in rear of the
nearest cover, as close as possible to the enemy’s position, and are to maintain
themselves there until artillery or neighboring troops can support
them. The fire of these troops is to give the enemy the impression that
an attack is to be made here also. “No matter how successful these usually
protracted fights may be. troops must be launched in a decisive attack at
some points. The infantry should endeavor to compensate for its numerical
inferiority by skillfully utilizing the ground and intrenchments, by
great activity, and, above all else, by invincible pertinacity. The supporting
point will thus become the center of the fight of a separate combat
group.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page457">[457]</span></p>

<p>The commander should endeavor to maintain cohesion, and to equalize
fluctuations in the combat by controlling the activity of the artillery
and by putting in fresh troops. During this group combat, the commander
must decide where the retained troops should be launched for
the assault. The selection of a point of attack is essentially the personal
task of the commander and is an index of character and of eye for the
value of ground, neither of which can be regulated by fixed rules. The
regulations do not believe that close order formations can be dispensed
with in launching the assaulting troops. Troops in close order, utilizing
the ground to the best advantage, so as to suffer but slight losses from
hostile fire, are to be brought up to the fighting line in a flexible echelon
formation in order to give to that line, as <i>troupes d’assaut</i>, the impetus
for the assault.</p>

<p>According to Thomas de Colligny,<a id="FNanchor490" href="#Footnote490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> formerly general staff officer of
the 9th Infantry Division, a battalion designated to make an assault
should form in four lines, each consisting of one company; the distance
between lines being 150 m., and the front covered likewise 150 m. Each
of the three leading lines should be formed in line of platoons in columns
of route at deploying intervals sufficient to allow single rank line to be
formed, and the fourth line in a similar formation with 10-pace intervals
between platoons. When one of the lines is checked, the next succeeding
one is to carry it forward. If the French believe such close order
formations to be indispensable, they will be compelled to make a more
extensive use of cover.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>Colonel Dencausse is the exponent of a suggestion made by General
Bonnal. The latter forms a division for attack as follows: One regiment,
on a front of 600 m., as the advanced line (<i>avant ligne</i>), in rear
of that, the assaulting troops (<i>troupes d’assaut</i>). First line: one regiment,
its twelve company columns abreast; second line: one regiment,
its three battalions in double column at extended intervals, 300 m. in
rear of the first line; third line: the fourth regiment, its battalions in route
column abreast of each other, 300 m. in rear of the second line. While,
during our peace maneuvers, we continue to fire on the enemy’s firing line
in the expectation that his supports and reserve will in the end enter our
zone of fire, it might be advisable, when confronted by a French opponent,
to direct our fire on his reserves as soon as these become visible.</p>

<p><b>Envelopment.</b> This is occasionally mentioned in the regulations (for
example in pars. 290, 301 and 302). However, the Field Service Regulations,
in discussing the attack, whose phases may vary in length depending
upon the intentions of the commander, state that the attacker “may
assail a wing or a flank of the enemy with superior forces for the purpose
of annihilating him.”</p>

<h5>DEFENSE.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The French defense is characterized by group fortifications, advanced
positions, and advanced posts<a id="FNanchor491" href="#Footnote491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> (intended to prevent hostile reconnaissance),
and numerous counter-attacks.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote491" href="#FNanchor491" class="label">[491]</a>
These frequently consist of detachments of all arms (<i>détachements de
couverture ou de contact</i>). General
<span class="smcap">Bonnal</span>. (<cite>Deutsche Revue</cite>, December number,
1907) says: “The French regulation&mdash;in contrast to the German&mdash;provide
in defense for detachments of all arms, which are pushed forward for the
purpose of compelling the enemy to show his dispositions, and to draw him
on in a direction favorable for the defender. Both systems have their advantages
and disadvantages, and we, for our part, are of the opinion that in sending
out advanced detachments one must exercise great care in order that these
may not be defeated in detail, for this is invariably detrimental to the whole
force.”</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>For defense, a force is divided into the firing line with its supports,
and the maneuvering troops (general reserve) intended for offensive
action. In addition to calling attention to the necessity of overwhelming
with fire the hostile troops advancing over open ground, the regulations
recommend that the fire be withheld occasionally and that the enemy be
allowed to run into the greatly accelerated fire which is unexpectedly
directed upon him. The fire is to be discontinued as soon as the enemy
takes to cover, and is to be increased to the utmost intensity when he moves
in dense formation over open ground. The supports are to be used to
augment the fire power of the firing line.</p>

<p><b>Counter-attack.</b> General Lacroix states: “The frontal attack is
met by the offensive return (<i>retour offensif</i>), the flank attack by the
counter-attack. In order to prepare for this, the commander should ride
ahead to examine the ground, and to consider what counter-measures he
should take. The artillery can render the most effective assistance by registering
its fire upon the points at which the enemy will probably advance,
and by preventing him from leaving his position. If the attack is successful,
the local reserve advances beyond the firing line, which has entered
the hostile position, and fires upon the retreating enemy. The general
reserve now becomes the local reserve, and the former firing line re-forms
and becomes the general reserve.”</p>

<p>The regulations make a distinction between counter-attack (<i>contre
attaque</i>) and offensive return (<i>retour offensif</i>). A <b>counter-attack</b> is made
by the reserve before the enemy penetrates into the energetically defended
supporting points. In contrast herewith, every attempt to retake a
captured position is called an <b>offensive return</b>. (For details see <a href="#Page439">p.
439</a> supra).</p>

<p>Occasionally, it may be advantageous not to await the crisis, but to
force the assailant to deploy by directing a heavy fire upon him. then to
break off the action, inducing the enemy to press on, in order to draw
him, by this means, onto previously selected and reconnoitered terrain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page459">[459]</span>
where he is suddenly attacked in flank by fresh troops. Military history
shows that this very procedure has frequently been successful.</p>

<p>“The same activity, the same determination to maneuver, must prevail
everywhere. Every mistake and every weakness of the enemy must be
quickly perceived and promptly utilized. The troops in the counter-attack
should move forward without hesitation and regardless of the cost. When
such a forward movement has to be discontinued, the commander must
decide where it shall cease. The efforts of all should be directed toward
one object, that of tiring and demoralizing the enemy by constant counter-attacks,
until the moment arrives when the commander must order the
offensive to be assumed.”</p>

<h5>ATTACK.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The regulations do not mention the rencontre. A normal offensive
battle consists of “an advance from point to point. Every lodgment made
in a new firing position weakens the enemy’s strength in his main position,
and paves the way for a further advance; every advance must be thoroughly
prepared and systematically carried out.”</p>

<p>In the following, the attack made by a brigade of four battalions is
used as a basis. While the commander reconnoiters under the protection
of his advance guard, the troops are concentrated in a “preparatory formation”,
the battalions in one or more lines of “quarter columns” (column
of companies). As soon as the commander has decided which flank of the
enemy he will envelop, against which portion of the enemy’s line he will
launch his decisive attack, he assembles his subordinate commanders to
receive the orders. According to the regulations, it will rarely be possible
to issue orders while the troops are still in march. The orders are, as
a general rule, to be given in writing, and are to be supplemented by
verbal instructions, in which the commander calls attention to the
peculiarities of the terrain, especially where a hostile counter-attack is
possible. In exceptional cases, the brigade commander designates the
position to be taken up by the machine guns, and gives directions to them
in regard to supporting the advance by long range fire. A base battalion
is to be designated. When the enemy’s position is visible, a point of attack
is assigned to every unit. When this is not practicable, the base battalion
is led forward by officers familiar with the ground, or it is given a compass
direction. Every leader is to provide independently for reconnaissance and
for communication by signal flags and also by telephone; a mounted signal
corps man accompanies the brigade commander.</p>

<p>Every unit is formed in three lines for attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page460">[460]</span></p>

<p>The <b>first line</b>, consisting of scouts and skirmishers with supports, is
made as weak as possible; without supports rarely more than one-fourth
of the whole force.</p>

<p>The <b>second line</b>, the reserves of the firing line, is under the orders
of the appropriate battalion commanders, and is to reinforce the firing
line, protect the Hanks, and deliver long range fire. The second line is
to fill up the firing line to the maximum density, <i>i.e.</i>, to one man per
yard of front (0.9 m.).</p>

<p>The <b>third line</b>, the general reserve, is to assure the success of the
attack. It is to be made as strong as possible, seldom less than one-fourth
of the whole force.<a id="FNanchor493" href="#Footnote493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> “The general reserve is directly under the
orders of the commander of the whole force. It enables him to meet
the varying contingencies of an engagement or to ward off counter-attacks.
If the attack succeeds, the general reserve pushes forward rapidly
to take up the pursuit; if the attack fails, it serves as a rallying force,
but before the commander decides to leave behind even a part of it, he
should consider whether, by launching all the troops at his disposal, he
could break down the resistance of the defender. The commander can
only exercise an influence on the course of the action by means of a
reserve. If he keeps in his own hands a strong reserve, he will have it
in his power to take advantage of any mistake the enemy may commit,
to restore the battle should the leading troops meet with a serious check,
to meet a counter-attack in force, or, in case of need, to provide the
additional strength required to drive the attack home.”</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote493" href="#FNanchor493" class="label">[493]</a> According to the old regulations, a part of the general reserve had to
remain in rear in rallying positions. (See <a href="#Page397">p. 397</a> supra).</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>In contrast with these provisions, we find, strangely enough, under
the heading “Brigade”, the hint that, when advancing to the assault, it is
advisable to keep back a portion of the reserve in a rallying position. Even
a battalion commander is invariably to retain at least half a company at
his disposal. The British were not without reason censured because their
flank attacks were ineffective in South Africa on account of the lack of
energy of the frontal groups, and their new regulations accordingly contain
detailed rules for the conduct of the “holding attack”. The troops
holding the enemy in front are to threaten him for the time being. This is
to be accomplished by wide extension, and by deceiving the enemy by
occasional bursts of lire (<i>rafales</i>), by employing machine guns, by retaining
supports far in rear, and by retraining, for the time being, from advancing
to decisive ranges. But the troops are to be ready to join in the main
attack when the latter advances. The regulations state that, in order to
deceive the enemy effectually, adequate forces will have to be launched and
that the commander will have to act vigorously. (See <a href="#Page447">p. 447</a> supra).</p>

<p>Fixed rules for the front to be covered by a unit in action are no longer
given. A unit fighting alone may cover considerably more front than when
acting as part of a larger force. In a decisive attack, a battalion in the
first line may put 125 rifles on every 100 yards (90 m.) of front; these
are distributed between firing line, supports, and battalion reserve; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page461">[461]</span>
latter may consist of one or more companies. Entire companies are only
deployed in exceptional cases, for example on open ground, where it is
difficult to bring up the supports. The size of the reserve depends upon
the losses to be anticipated in the firing line; when these will be small,
in all probability, the reserve may be made as strong as the firing line
plus supports. In attack, a battalion may accordingly deploy on a front
not exceeding 800 yards (formerly 540 m. was prescribed). A brigade
of four battalions may deploy on a front of 1400-2100 m., depending upon
the number of battalions engaged.</p>

<p>When the force arrives within 4 or 5 km. of the enemy, the battalions
are formed in two lines of companies. Each company in the first line
is preceded by a platoon in close order, and this is in turn protected by
scouts. As soon as these scouts can advance no farther, they lie down and
await the arrival of the fighting line. The latter advances under cover
of the supporting fire of infantry, machine guns, and artillery. Fire of
position is considered necessary. Fire at will is from now on used. This
is to vary in intensity according to the character of the target, and the
range. It is to increase to special violence when the attacking infantry
advances over level ground or encounters obstacles. The fire is to be
discontinued when the advancing skirmishers reach cover. The firing line
is to advance as close to the enemy as it can without suffering excessive
losses. Fire is to be opened when the hostile fire makes this necessary,
but small losses are to be borne.</p>

<p>After the fire fight is once begun, it is to be conducted with more
rifles than the enemy has in action. “Battles are only won by controlled
fire directed upon targets at decisive ranges” (according to the regulations,
at ranges under 540 m.). Within the zone of effective fire, all the troops
are to deploy. In consequence of this, skirmishers, who endeavor to work
forward independently, are scattered all over the terrain over which the
attack is being made. At the initial deployment, the interval between
skirmishers is to be about 5-15 paces; at short ranges, at points where
the decision is sought, there is to be at least one rifle for every two or
three yards of front (1.80-2.70 m. = 2<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>-3<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> paces). Another paragraph
of the regulations prescribes that the maximum density is to be one rifle
per yard of front. The British views, when compared to those entertained
by them immediately after the South African war, have undergone a
noticeable change, especially as regards the frontage of a firing line; dense
firing lines, possessing strong fire power, are at present deemed essential
to a decisive fight, while the fire of widely extended lines is considered
ineffective. The intervals may vary considerably, but the regulations state
that it should be borne in mind that the difficulties of conducting a fight
are increased and the fire power reduced when too great a front is covered;
moreover, that in covered terrain, and when counter-attacks may be anticipated,
an overextension is actually dangerous. Because of the necessity
of moving in thin skirmish lines, it is considered essential that the men be
trained to act independently, to continue the fight even in a difficult situation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page462">[462]</span>
and to do everything in their power to carry out the original intentions
of the commander.</p>

<p><b>Rushes</b> over open ground are not to exceed 80-100 yards (72-92
m.) in length; as a rule they are to be shorter. According to an example
given in the Firing Regulations, rushes are to be 25 yards (22 m.)
long, at ranges from 650-500 yards (580-450 m.). A rush is to be
continued while the enemy’s surprise lasts and he finds no opportunity
to deliver aimed fire. In covered terrain, the rushes are to be made
from one covering feature to another.</p>

<p>“On open ground and within effective range, long lines of skirmishers,
rising simultaneously, will suffer heavy losses even when making
short rushes; the sudden movement of smaller units may take the enemy
unawares, so that for a time at least well aimed fire is avoided. The
rush is continued only while the surprise of the enemy lasts. The shorter
the range, the smaller the advancing unit will have to be, and the
shorter the length of the rushes.”</p>

<p>The dispositions for a rush are to be made as unostentatiously as
possible. The rearward detachments, which follow by rushes, are to
advance, if possible, beyond the group already firing. When squads are
unable to advance by rushes, the men may crawl forward singly.</p>

<p>The regulations state that, when in close order, units of the strength
of company columns (80-100 men, 4 platoons, in column of platoons at
full distances), having a front of 10-12 files, suffer comparatively small
losses when exposed to long range fire (1800-1200 m.). The troops
are to deploy before reaching effective ranges (1200-600 m.), as they
will otherwise suffer serious losses. At decisive ranges the firing line
is to be filled up to its maximum density.</p>

<p>The whole force, a small part excepted, is to be launched in the
<b>assault</b>; a sudden and unexpected advance of the assaulting troops is
considered particularly important. The order for the assault is to be
given by the commander of the whole force, but the manner of conducting
it is left to company commanders.</p>

<p>When the attack would be too costly by day, however, the troops are
to intrench, wait until it is dark, and then advance to assaulting distance,
where they again intrench (machine guns, and even single field guns
are to be taken along). The assault is to be made, after a brief but
violent fire fight, at the first streak of dawn.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In defense, a force is divided into the fighting line with supports,
and the reserve. The latter furnishes the outposts and the garrisons for
the advanced positions (so-called temporary positions). The object of
<b>advanced positions</b> is to mislead, deceive, and check the enemy. They
are to be evacuated before the troops in them become seriously engaged.
It is not considered necessary for the <b>main position</b> to consist of a continuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page463">[463]</span>
line of trenches; every platoon and even every squad may have
its own trench. The principal requirements are good field of fire and
mutual support by oblique or enfilade fire.</p>

<p>The strength of the garrison is to be governed by the size of the
field of fire and the character of the works. The regulations state that,
under favorable conditions, a few men can defend a broad front, but
that, when the attack is favored by the terrain, a strong garrison is
required. Firing trenches, unless they are to serve as dummy intrenchments,
are not to be constructed so as to stand out against the horizon.
The importance of masking firing trenches, and of constructing overhead
cover is emphasized; special cover trenches for the supports may be
constructed in rear of the crest.</p>

<p>Against skirmishers, fire is to be opened at 1000 m., but it is also
considered desirable to withhold the fire until they get within short
range. It is believed that this will be attended by success when the
assailant is ignorant of the position of the defender or makes his attack
with poorly disciplined troops. Continuous long range firing tires the
eye and the hand. The decision is to be brought about by a <b>counter-attack</b>
made by the general reserve. Local counter-attacks by section
reserves are also recommended. The tendency of the British to make the
section reserves very strong has been frequently observed. The final
stage of the combat consists, as in Wellington’s day, of a counter-attack
all along the line. As soon as the opponent has arrived within assaulting
distance, the troops holding the position are to fix bayonets and, after
delivering magazine fire, are to make a short frontal counter-attack.</p>

<h4>THE JAPANESE DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1907.</h4>

<h5>ATTACK.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The Japanese views coincide almost exactly with the German, but
take their peculiar theater of war into consideration.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of fire.</b> Fire at will, volley fire, and rapid fire are used.</p>

<p><b>Rushes</b> are not to exceed 100 m. in length, as a rule, but the regulations
admonish leaders to “guard against the mistake of making rushes
that are too short. When rushes are shorter than 30-40 m., their value
will be insignificant, as a rule.” Leaders are likewise to avoid sending
forward units smaller than a platoon, in order that the advance may not
be too much retarded and the difficulties of leading increased.</p>

<p>The regulations particularly emphasize that it will rarely be possible
“to shoot an enemy out of his position”, and that, on this account,
the decision will, as a rule, be brought about by the assault with cold
steel. They further state that, when the enemy can be kept down by
artillery fire, the advance of the infantry will be easy; that, as it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page464">[464]</span>
difficult to obtain a timely effect from artillery fire directed upon an
enemy who takes advantage of cover or who occupies a fortified position,
the infantry cannot wait for the successful termination of the artillery
combat, but, on the contrary, should advance while that combat is in
progress, for only by so doing can it count upon the effective coöperation
of its artillery. But, nevertheless, infantry is to make the attack independently,
even if it has to dispense entirely with the coöperation of the
artillery.</p>

<p>The regulations consider the rencontre and the attack on a position
prepared for defense.</p>

<p><b>Rencontre.</b> The regulations prescribe that in a rencontre the advance
guard should make a vigorous but, at the same time, deliberate attack;
that the commander should promptly decide what to do, even if the
situation is not entirely clear; and that, when practicable, the main body
should be launched as an entity. A fight against a superior enemy is
only to be avoided, for the time being, in case the latter has gained a
start in deployment.</p>

<p><b>Attack on a position prepared for defense.</b> The commander
frames his plan of attack according to the results of the reconnaissance,
and leads his troops forward provisionally into a preparatory position,
where he assigns deployment spaces and, if practicable, combat sections
to the different units. In order that they may utilize the covering
features of the ground to the best advantage, the different units are to
avoid advancing abreast. On account of the difficulties attending an
advance over ground swept by hostile fire, it is considered desirable for
the troops to take advantage of the cover afforded by darkness. In
order that, in such a case, serious lateral displacements of the troops
may be avoided, the fighting line is to be sent forward the day before to
endeavor to drive back the troops posted in front of the enemy’s main
position. The regulations state that, when an attack is contemplated to
be made during daylight against a strong position prepared for defense,
there is no alternative but to approach the assaulting position by intrenching
successive attack positions, but that, when circumstances permit, an
attempt must be made to advance under cover of darkness to the enemy’s
position. In the latter case, the assaulting position is to be designated
during the day, after a thorough reconnaissance, and detailed preparations
are to be made for the advance. As soon as the troops arrive
during the night in the selected position, they are to construct cover
quickly, and to intrench. When the ground is so hard that intrenching
tools cannot be used without difficulty, recourse is to be had to the sand
bags that are carried along. The men engaged in digging trenches are
at all times to be ready for action.</p>

<p>The regulations state that whether a force which has occupied an
assaulting position should make the <b>assault</b> immediately at dawn or
should first prepare it by fire, will depend on circumstances; and that,
if attempted at dawn, the success of the assault will depend on the suddenness<span class="pagenum" id="Page465">[465]</span>
and rapidity with which it is carried out. The reconnaissance of
the position and the work of removing obstacles is to be completed, if
possible, during the night, so that avenues of approach will be open for
the assaulting troops.</p>

<p>If the reconnaissance has gained all the necessary information, and
if the preparations are completed, the assault may be made before the
night is over. The regulations say that, when an assault is made at
night, the distance to be covered should be very short; and that it will
depend on circumstances whether the assault is made suddenly, directly
from the last firing position, or whether it is carried out upon the completion
of works of approach. When necessary the assaulting bodies are
to carry along hand grenades and demolition tools, the latter being
selected in conformity with the results of the reconnaissance.</p>

<p>The regulations state that to have captured a position does not
suffice; that only the pursuit and dispersion of the enemy makes the
victory complete. The troops that have penetrated into the hostile position
are to continue the advance until they again find a field of fire, whereupon
they are to fire upon the retreating enemy. The troops which do
not take part in this fire are to re-form quickly, secure the captured
position, take requisite measures for security, and make preparations to
meet any hostile counter-attack. Troops are not to be assembled in large
bodies at points exposed to hostile artillery fire. As soon as the enemy
has gotten out of range, all the troops are promptly to resume the
forward movement, and are to pursue him vigorously so far as due
regard for cohesion and order permits.</p>

<p><b>Intrenching tools</b> are to be used in attacks on fortified positions,
and in strengthening ground captured from the enemy.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<h5>DEFENSE.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>In defense, the Japanese regulations, like the German, provide for
economical occupation of the front (group fortifications) and a general
reserve, which is to be used offensively or to protect the flanks. Dummy
intrenchments, patrols, and outposts are to make it difficult for the
enemy to gain information of the defensive position. The Japanese
views in regard to <b>advanced positions</b> are not so pronounced as the
German, for, while their regulations mention the combat of the outposts
pushed forward from the position, the danger of advanced positions is not
especially emphasized.</p>

<p>The training of the soldier is to be such that even after he has
fired away all of his ammunition, he will still defend his position with
the bayonet.</p>

<p>Nothing is said in regard to the distance of the infantry position
from that of the artillery. If information is received that the attacker
has made a lodgment during the night in the assaulting position, small
detachments are to advance and prevent him from strengthening his
position.</p>

<h4>THE SWISS DRILL REGULATIONS OF 1908.</h4>

<h5>ATTACK.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>There is considerable similarity between the Swiss and the German
regulations. The keynote is the offensive. The purpose of the combat
and the condition of the troops are to govern the commander in deciding
whether to stand on the defensive or to attack. The regulations state that
decisive results are only offered by the attack; that considerations of a
presumable hostile superiority and other apparently unfavorable conditions
should not diminish the energy of the attack; and that the decision to
launch the troops should never be made dependent upon the receipt of
reports in regard to the enemy.</p>

<p>The offensive is invariably to be assumed, unless the situation or
the mission compel the force to stand on the defensive. The regulations
state that, in attack, success does not rest alone upon superiority of fire
and superiority of numbers; but that an impetuous advance and an
unswerving determination to win are of just as much importance. The
conduct of the Swiss attack varies, depending upon whether it is made
in a rencontre or on a position prepared for defense.</p>

<p>The views entertained in regard to the <b>rencontre</b> coincide with the
German views. The regulations say that the result of the reconnaissance
should not be awaited, because success depends largely upon prompt
action. The commander may launch parts of his main body in succession,
as soon as they arrive, when the force is operating in close country, when
it is necessary to gain ground quickly on debouching from a defile, or
when the enemy makes an impetuous advance. The commander is to
direct all his efforts toward throwing the enemy upon the defensive, and
then to launch the main body as an entity.</p>

<p>The Swiss regulations, similar to those of the Japanese, only discuss
the <b>attack on a fortified position</b>; various modifications of the attack,
depending upon the preparations made by the enemy, are authorized.
Advantage is to be taken of the cover afforded by darkness, and an
extensive use is to be made of <b>intrenching tools</b>. The regulations state
that an assault by day only has a chance of succeeding when the defender
is completely subdued, and when only insignificant obstacles and defenses
are encountered. When this is not the case, the day is to be used for
making preparations for the attack, and the night for executing it.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page467">[467]</span></p>

<h5>DEFENSE.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The regulations consider the involuntary defense in a rencontre; the
deliberately prepared defense seeking a decision and contemplating an
assumption of the offensive; the defense for the purpose of gaining
time; and the occupation of a position in readiness, when the direction in
which the hostile attack will be made is still in doubt, or when the commander
intends to assail the enemy while the latter is in the act of
deploying. In the <b>defense seeking a decision</b>, advanced positions are
not to be used, because it is believed that the employment of detachments
of troops in front of the defensive position will weaken the latter, and a
hostile enveloping attack will soon force the advanced troops to fall
back upon the main position. The regulations point out that if the
advanced troops are supported by fire from the main position, the latter
will be prematurely disclosed to the assailant. The employment of advanced
troops is, however, considered justifiable to hold defiles, to deceive
the enemy, or to support the cavalry.</p>

<p>The works of a position are not to be continuous, but are to be
constructed in groups. Infantry positions over which artillery is to fire are
not to be less than 500 m. in front of the latter.</p>

<h4>1. HISTORICAL SKETCH.</h4>

<p>The question of ammunition supply in action is of vital
importance to the infantry. To solve it correctly means to
assure the success of the infantry in fire action. The first
question that needs consideration is, whether the experiences
of past wars show that the ammunition at present carried by
the infantry is sufficient, under all circumstances, even when
ammunition columns cannot reach the battlefield in time because
all the roads are choked with troops.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>For our purpose, it is sufficient to go back as far as the <b>Franco-German
war</b>, in which breechloaders were used for the first time against
breechloaders. Every German soldier carried 80 cartridges, and the 6-horse
battalion ammunition wagons carried 20 additional rounds per
man.<a id="FNanchor495" href="#Footnote495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>When one considers the total number of cartridges expended during
any campaign, it seems impossible that a shortage of ammunition could
ever have taken place. In the <b>Franco-German war</b>, the expenditure of
ammunition in the Ist Bavarian Army Corps amounted to 4,163,000
rounds (166 per rifle); in the IInd Army Corps, 1,105,600 rounds (44
per rifle); and in the Saxon Army Corps, 1,450,000 rounds (about 58
per rifle). The compilation of a table, showing the amount of ammunition
expended in the Prussian army, was begun, but was soon discontinued,
as it was found that the necessary data were lacking, the only
information available being the record of the number of rounds issued by
the reserve ammunition parks. The troops sent to the field army from
the depot battalions, must have brought with them in each case a very
considerable amount of ammunition, as each man carried 80 rounds, but no
records are available to show how much ammunition was forwarded in
this way. Furthermore, there is no record of the number of rounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page469">[469]</span>
actually expended and of the amount of ammunition lost or left on the
dead and wounded. It is well known, that in the long periods, during
which no engagement had taken place, an enormous amount of ammunition
was lost on marches and in bivouacs. This applies likewise to
battlefields. The commander of an ammunition column had his men
pick up 22,000 rounds of needle gun ammunition in unbroken packages
on the battlefield of <b>Hühnerwasser</b>.</p>

<p>A shortage of ammunition first manifested itself where the troops, on
removing their knapsacks, had neglected to take out the tin boxes filled
with ammunition (for example in the 12th Jäger-Battalion at <b>Sedan</b>),<a id="FNanchor496" href="#Footnote496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>
or where the ammunition wagons had been sent to the rear with the
field train (for example in the 50th Infantry, on January 19th, 1871, in
the battle at <b>Mont Valérien</b>, and in the 38th Brigade, at the battle of
<b>Beaune la Rolande</b>).<a id="FNanchor497" href="#Footnote497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>

<p>The regimental histories contain only a few statements in regard to
the amount of ammunition expended in the various engagements. Moreover,
these statements are only approximations and, as a rule, cannot
lay claim to trustworthiness.</p>

<p>The amount of ammunition expended in the opening battles of the
war was very small, due to the training and fighting methods of the
Prussian infantry, and to the support it received from the artillery. Moreover,
the short range of the rifle prohibited long range firing.</p>

<p>“In order to hold its own against the intensity and long range of
the hostile fire, the German infantry was compelled to fire more rapidly
and at longer ranges than it had intended. In addition, the difficulties
of fire control and fire direction were frequently increased on account of
the tremendous loss of leaders. Under these circumstances, so much ammunition
was expended that, among the troops fighting in the first line,
the ammunition carried by the men was no more than enough. This
explains why it not infrequently happened that the fighting efficiency of
the infantry was impaired by a lack of ammunition. The first general
shortage of ammunition occurred at the battle of <b>Mars-la-Tour</b> in the
infantry of the IIIrd Army Corps.”<a id="FNanchor498" href="#Footnote498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>

spite of this, the ammunition ran short. During the lull in the battle
at noon, by removing the cartridges from the dead and wounded, each
man in the 35th Infantry<a id="FNanchor499" href="#Footnote499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> was again supplied with about 200 rounds

<p>A very annoying shortage of ammunition occurred in those parts
of the Leib Regiment which were with the 72nd and 40th Infantry
Regiments in front of the wood. The retained echelons in the wood had
sufficient ammunition, but the troops in front lacked the means wherewith
to inform the retained units of the shortage. In the 11th and 72nd
Infantry Regiments a serious shortage of ammunition occurred after
they had been engaged but a short time. (In a little less than two
hours, the 72nd Infantry suffered the following percentage of losses: Ist
Battalion, 53.2%; Füsilier Battalion, 48.2%).<a id="FNanchor500" href="#Footnote500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<p>The defense of the stone wall at <b>Buzanval</b> by the 50th Infantry
(German), on January 19th, 1871, was one of the most obstinate defensive
fights of the war. The numerical superiority of the enemy at this point
was overwhelming and his troops were excellent, nevertheless the regiment
maintained the same splendid fire discipline it had already exhibited
at Lundby. The fight lasted nine hours. In his history of the
regiment (p. 350), Lieutenant-General v. Boguslawski says:</p>

<p>“The number of cartridges fired can no longer be accurately determined.
Only the war diary of the IInd Battalion contains a note showing
that 14,206 rounds were expended. As the 5th Company did not
fire at all, and the 7th Company was only partially engaged, by far the
greater portion of the ammunition must have been expended by the 6th
and 8th Companies.” The IInd Battalion, like the rest, has no record
showing what ammunition was supplied to it during the battle. To
cite an example: The 12th Company received about 3,000 rounds of
ammunition during the fight. As the strength of this company was 180
men in round numbers, each man received 17 additional cartridges. He
therefore had 97 rounds available, including the ammunition originally
supplied him.</p>

<p>“Now, as each man still had an average of 5 cartridges on going
into billets, he must have expended 92 rounds. From this we may assume
that during the nine hours’ fight, he fired a little more than ten rounds
per hour.”</p>

<p>In the battle of <b>Beaune la Rolande</b>, some of the companies of the
56th Infantry near Romainville had expended all their ammunition. In
the 38th Brigade, only the Ist Battalion, 57th Infantry, was able to replenish<span class="pagenum" id="Page471">[471]</span>
its ammunition directly from the ammunition wagons near Romainville.
The defenders of Beaune did not receive such assistance however, as only
one ammunition wagon was brought up (by the Füsilier-Battalion, 16th
Infantry), toward the close of the battle, for the units engaged there.
The ammunition it contained was distributed among the men, but was
not used. Organizations belonging to the IIIrd Army Corps turned over
some of their ammunition, but, in general, the brigade had to rely practically
on the ammunition carried by the men, for all the ammunition
wagons had driven off at the beginning of the battle. Consequently, this
battle was fought almost exclusively with the ammunition carried by the
men&mdash;about 80 rounds per rifle. As the French attack was not simultaneously
directed against the whole front of Beaune, lulls occurred in
the fight, which enabled the officers to send a supply of ammunition to the
most seriously threatened points of the line. In a well disciplined organization,
it is not difficult to send ammunition promptly to the most seriously
threatened points by simply passing it along the line. This was actually
done at Beaune la Rolande. In consequence of this redistribution, at
some points in the cemetery, men fired as many as 200 rounds each, but
others fired only 40 or less; the result, however, was the same, for the
ammunition was almost exclusively supplied from that carried by the men&mdash;80
rounds per rifle. Moreover, a great many cartridges, and even
unopened packages of ammunition, were found, on November 29th, in the
position occupied by the 38th Brigade.</p>

<p>The following figures give an idea of the amount of ammunition
expended at <b>St. Privat</b> by the 2nd Regiment of the Guard. On August
19th, the Ist Battalion required 27,340, the IInd Battalion 17,820, and the
Füsilier-Battalion 7,870 rounds to replenish their ammunition supply.
When the heavy losses suffered by this regiment are taken into account,
the average expenditure of ammunition cannot be considered excessive.<a id="FNanchor501" href="#Footnote501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>The expenditure of ammunition on the French side was considerably
greater in all the battles. At <b>Champigny</b>, every French infantry soldier
carried 118 rounds of ammunition, which did not prove sufficient, however,
to meet the demand. In the French Army of the Rhine, the average expenditure
of ammunition from August 6th to 31st was 30 rounds, and in the
fights of August 16th and 18th, 13 to 27 rounds per rifle. In individual cases,
the expenditure of ammunition was far in excess of these figures. The

directed, claim that they fired as many as 150 rounds apiece, on August
16th. In the evening, at the close of the battle, the commanding general<span class="pagenum" id="Page472">[472]</span>
of the IVth Army Corps reported a shortage of ammunition.<a id="FNanchor503" href="#Footnote503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> Shortage of
ammunition caused Marshal Bazaine to fall back to Metz on August 17th.
Notwithstanding the proximity of the fortress of Metz, the French VIth
Corps was unable to replenish its supply of ammunition before it was attacked
by the Prussian Guard. Detailed information available in regard to
the ammunition expended by the 25th Infantry (French)<a id="FNanchor504" href="#Footnote504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> shows that each
man had only 30 instead of 90 cartridges. (This was the regiment attacked
by the Franz and 3rd Guard Regiments, who lost 2,160 men&mdash;9%
hits). The statement made in the history of the 2nd Guard Regiment (p.
233), that every French soldier had 300 rounds of ammunition available on
August 18th, cannot be substantiated by French records.</p>

<p>The expenditure of ammunition in the <b>Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78</b>,
amounted to 33 rounds per rifle and carbine on the Russian side. The following
detailed statements in regard to the expenditure of ammunition are
available. In the engagement at <b>Aiaslar</b>, on August 23rd, 1877, the Sofia
Regiment expended 94 rounds, and at <b>Karahassankioi</b>, the 140th Infantry
expended 155 rounds per man. On December 28th, 1877, the 13th Rifle Battalion
expended 122 rounds per man. In this connection, it may be remarked
that the Russian infantryman of that day carried 60 rounds of ammunition
in his cartridge boxes. The ammunition carts carried 55 additional
rounds per man, and the ammunition parks 62. If, as prescribed
by the regulations at that time, only one ammunition wagon followed an
organization into action, each infantryman had 78 rounds available, and
each man of a rifle battalion 106 rounds.</p>

<p>In front of <b>Plevna</b>, on July 20th, 1877, the Russians expended in six
hours all the ammunition carried by the men and by the ammunition carts.
On July 30th, during the second assault on <b>Plevna</b>, they expended in four
hours all the ammunition carried by the men.<a id="FNanchor505" href="#Footnote505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
In the engagement at <b>Lovtcha</b>,
the 3rd Rifle Brigade only fired during the pursuit. The brigade commander
explained afterwards that his ammunition had run short nevertheless. During
the advance, the ammunition wagons did not follow in rear of the organizations
to which they belonged, and no provision had been made for
bringing up the necessary ammunition.<a id="FNanchor506" href="#Footnote506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>In the Kasan Regiment (No. 64), which had expended less ammunition
than any of the others on this day, the ammunition began to run short at the
moment when the successful and decisive counter-attack of the Turks commenced.
The same misfortune befell other organizations, after the fire
fight had lasted but a comparatively short time, as apparently they had neglected
to remove the cartridges from the dead and wounded.</p>

<p>During the assault on <b>Scheinovo</b>, on January 9th, 1878, each man of
the 11th Rifle Battalion fired 120 rounds in four hours. This is an average
of 2 rounds per man, per minute.</p>

<p>The Turks took more advantage of the rapidity of fire of their rifles
than did the Russians.<a id="FNanchor508" href="#Footnote508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> It is said that at <b>Gorni Dubniac</b>, each man had
800-900 rounds of ammunition available, and it is a fact, that the force
of 3,570 men garrisoning the group of works placed 3,533 Russians out
of action, in a fight lasting 9<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub> hours, while the Turkish losses in killed and
wounded only amounted to 1,280 men. During the attack, some Turks
managed to fire more than 100 rounds apiece. Kuropatkin found 120 empty
cartridge shells beside a dead Turkish soldier.<a id="FNanchor509" href="#Footnote509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> In the engagement at

<p>There is very little information available in regard to the expenditure
of ammunition during the <b>Russo-Japanese war</b>. The Russian infantryman
carried 120 rounds of ammunition, the 8 one-horse ammunition carts carried
6,600 rounds per company, and the 2 two-horse ammunition wagons of the
battalions 14,400 rounds each. Assuming the strength of a company as 200,
this would give 210 rounds per man. In the engagement at <b>Hamatan</b>
(<b>Yalu</b>), several Russian organizations ran entirely out of ammunition. A
number of rifle companies (the 6th Company, 11th Infantry, and the 2nd,
3rd and 4th, 12th Infantry), were able to replenish their supply without
difficulty from the ammunition wagons. The following is taken from a
thoroughly reliable report published in the <cite>Kölnische Zeitung</cite> of September
24th, 1905:</p>

<p>During the battle of <b>Liao Yang</b>, which lasted six days, the 138th Infantry
fired 99,460, and the 139th Infantry 96,040 rounds. On September 1st, the
137th Infantry expended 189,000 rounds, in other words, nearly twice as
much in one day as either of the other regiments expended in six. This
excessive expenditure of ammunition was due to the very severe attacks
which this regiment had to withstand on that day. These attacks were repeated
on the next day and the regiment expended 169,000 rounds of ammunition.
From October 13th to 18th, at <b>Linshinpu</b>, the 139th Infantry<span class="pagenum" id="Page474">[474]</span>
expended 351,800 rounds. During this engagement the Japanese succeeded
in getting within 10 m. of the Russian lines. Thirty bodies were picked up
at 15 paces, and 580 bodies from 100 to 150 paces from the Russian position.
The 139th Infantry lost 54 men killed, and 6 officers and 250 men wounded.
Major V. Tettau<a id="FNanchor511" href="#Footnote511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> states that during the battle of <b>Liao Yang</b> (30th August,
1904), the 36th Infantry expended 416,800 rounds of ammunition, and the
34th Infantry (two battalions), 250,000 rounds, or for 4,200 Russian rifles an
average of not less than 160 rounds per rifle.</p>

<p>The Japanese infantryman carried 120 rounds, and each company had,
in addition, one two-wheeled ammunition cart carrying 16,000 rounds of
ammunition. When packs were removed, each man carried a bag in which
were packed three days’ rations, and from 200 to 250 cartridges. The Japanese
infantry invariably followed the principle that each man should be supplied
with as much ammunition as possible before going into action. In the
engagement at <b>Kinchau</b> (26th November, 1904), the 1st Infantry Division
expended 64, the 3rd 54, and the 4th 143 rounds per man of the original
effective strength.<a id="FNanchor512" href="#Footnote512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>Although, according to the examples cited, 100 to 150
rounds of ammunition per man will in general suffice in battle,
cases may arise where troops could fire a greater number
of rounds to good advantage. This must be taken into account
when determining the number of rounds with which the infantryman
should be supplied&mdash;on his person and in the ammunition
wagons. Moreover, it must be remembered that the
supply can be replenished without difficulty from the ammunition
columns after a battle, so long as it is still possible to assign
a separate road to each army corps. When this is no
longer practicable, the ammunition columns will encounter almost
insurmountable difficulties in supplying the infantry
with ammunition.</p>

<h4>2. REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE SUPPLY OF
AMMUNITION IN THE VARIOUS ARMIES.</h4>

<h5>GERMANY.<br />
<span class="nonbold">(Pars. 479-482 F.S.R.)</span></h5>

<p>On the march, it is best to assemble all the company ammunition
wagons of the battalions, as this renders supervision
easier, and enables the battalion commander to regulate the
replenishment of ammunition. Companies acting alone, as
well as those forming the support of an advance guard, are
followed by their ammunition wagons. It does not seem
desirable to unite the ammunition wagons of a regiment or
of a brigade on account of the distance separating the different
battalions. During the march to the battlefield, the ammunition<span class="pagenum" id="Page477">[477]</span>
should be taken out of the knapsacks, and the contents
of the ammunition wagons distributed among the men.
The men carry this extra ammunition in their haversacks and
in their coat and trousers’ pockets, etc.</p>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The two-horse company ammunition wagon, Model 1897, has a width
of track of 1.53 m., and, when empty, weighs 450 kg. Compared with the
ammunition wagon Model C, 1887, which was originally designed to carry
ammunition in boxes, it is lighter by 75 kg., and can be turned within a
shorter radius. The wagon body is provided with double doors in front and
in rear. The interior is divided into four compartments (to be emptied
separately), each capable of holding 16 bundles of cartridges placed on
end. Each bundle contains 15 packages of 15 cartridges in clips each. Each
bundle of 225 cartridges weighs 7.25 kg.</p>

<p>As three bundles of cartridges are to be carried by one man, according
to the Field Service Regulations (par. 480), 1 non-commissioned officer and
21 men are detailed to unload the ammunition wagon. The unloading is
managed as follows: Four men take post on each side of the wagon, two
handing out the bundles to the other two, who lay them on the ground.
The remaining men place the bundles in piles of three in such a manner
that the carrying loops of two in each pile can be interlaced and held together
by a stick or a bayonet. An ammunition wagon can be emptied in
this manner in four minutes. The two ammunition bundles tied together
are slung over the left shoulder, the rifle is slung over the right shoulder,
and the third bundle is carried in the right hand. In this way, a man can
carry 21.8 kg.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<p>Each man is issued 60 to 75 cartridges from the ammunition
wagon. These weigh from 1.8 to 2.4 kg. When issued
too soon, this additional burden causes considerable inconvenience,
and consequently reduces the marching power of the
men. The leader must also decide what shall be done with the
ammunition in case it has been issued prematurely, and the
troops fail to get into action. As soon as the ammunition
wagons are emptied, they are sent to the rear in charge of the
mounted wagonmaster, and refilled from the ammunition columns.
When refilled, they rejoin their proper organizations.
If requested, ammunition must be issued to any body of
troops.</p>

<p>On the battlefield, ammunition wagons, unless they have
been emptied, follow the movements of the several companies
and take up a position under cover, indicated by the wagonmaster,<span class="pagenum" id="Page478">[478]</span>
as close as possible to the firing line&mdash;never more than
800 m. in rear of it. In urgent cases, this must be done without
regard to losses. The firing line is supplied with ammunition,
when practicable, by the reinforcements sent forward. When
the firing line is about to run short of ammunition, this fact
is communicated to the troops in rear by repeatedly making the
signal “m”. This signal, when made to the front by the troops
in rear, signifies, “ammunition is coming up at once.”</p>

<p>In exceptional cases, when ammunition must be sent to
the firing line by individual men, the latter should invariably
be detailed from troops in rear which have not as yet been engaged.
These men must endeavor to reach the firing line by
rushes or by crawling, and must then remain with that line.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the battalion commander to see that the
ammunition taken from the ammunition wagons is promptly
replaced. The higher commanders would do well to provide
a reserve supply of ammunition, until the arrival of the ammunition
columns, by assembling the ammunition wagons of
the troops held in reserve. (Par. 482 F. S. R.). It will also
be advisable to assign some of the ammunition wagons of the
troops held in reserve to the organizations who will, in all
probability, expend a large amount of ammunition.</p>

<p>The ammunition should be removed from the dead and
wounded. If this is done by the men of an advancing skirmish
line, there is danger that the forward movement will be
retarded, and that some of the men will take advantage of
this opportunity to make themselves “scarce.” Officers and
men should endeavor to replenish ammunition at every opportunity,
without awaiting specific orders to that effect, and, in
general, see that not only the prescribed number of rounds, but,
on the contrary, as much ammunition as possible is on hand
in the organization.</p>

<p>When the force is to stand on the defensive, especially if
the position to be occupied has been prepared for defense, ammunition
should be deposited all along the firing line. (Cartridge
boxes or other utensils may be used as receptacles). It<span class="pagenum" id="Page479">[479]</span>
is advisable to use first the cartridges carried in caps, haversacks,
coat and trousers’ pockets. The contents of the right
cartridge box are saved for decisive moments when great
rapidity of fire is essential. In replenishing ammunition, the
right cartridge box is filled first, then the left, and the surplus
is accommodated in haversack, coat and trousers’ pockets.</p>

<h5>AUSTRIA.<br />
<span class="nonbold">(Par. 70 Regulations of 1903).</span></h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The regulations are extremely thorough and deserve special attention.
If an engagement is imminent, each private receives 20 additional rounds
before leaving the bivouac or reserve position, and each non-commissioned
officer 100 rounds from the company ammunition wagon, so that the latter is
about half emptied.<a id="FNanchor517" href="#Footnote517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> This brings the total amount carried by each soldier
up to 140 rounds, and increases the load of the privates by 0.71 kg., and
that of the non-commissioned officers by about 4 kg. When troops go into
action, the ammunition wagons are assembled and accompany the battalion
reserve, taking as much advantage of cover as possible, so that the attention
of the enemy may not be drawn to them. After the battalion reserve has
been absorbed by the firing line, the ammunition wagons accompany the
regimental reserve. When exposed to artillery fire, the wagons maintain
intervals of twenty paces from one another. They are either placed under
the orders of the battalion adjutant, or of the senior supply officer present
with them, as may be directed by the battalion commander.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote517" href="#FNanchor517" class="label">[517]</a> The company ammunition wagon carries 9,450 rounds of ammunition,
packed in seven compartments. It consists of a body and a limber, has a
width of track of 1.13 m., and is supplied with eight sacks which serve to
carry ammunition to the troops. During the day its position is indicated by
a red flag, and at night by a green lantern.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>In attack, it will, as a rule, only be possible to replenish ammunition
until troops get within about 1,000 paces (750 m.) of the enemy. From
this point on, however, it will be extremely difficult to supply ammunition.
Every lull in the fight must be taken advantage of to replenish ammunition.
The firing line receives a fresh supply of ammunition through reinforcements
or through small detachments under non-commissioned officers sent
forward from the reserves. These detachments, after distributing the ammunition
they have brought up, remain with the firing line. The companies
engaged in the fire fight later take advantage of every opportunity to replenish
and to redistribute ammunition.</p>

<p>In defense, all the ammunition wagons may be emptied before the
action begins, and sent to the rear to be refilled. The ammunition should
be deposited in the vicinity of the firing line. The subsequent replenishment
of the supply should be managed as in an attack. If ammunition is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page480">[480]</span>
urgently needed by the firing line, and when no other remedy suggests itself,
a part of the ammunition of the reserves may be turned over to the firing
line. Special detachments should be detailed to remove the ammunition
from the dead and wounded. Wounded men who are able to walk to the
dressing station, turn over their ammunition to their comrades.</p>

<p>If another organization requests to be furnished ammunition, the entire
amount required, or a part thereof, depending upon the urgency of the case
and the amount available, should be turned over to it.</p>

</div><!--longquote-->

<h5 title="RUSSIA.">RUSSIA.<a id="FNanchor518" href="#Footnote518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></h5>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote518" href="#FNanchor518" class="label">[518]</a> In each battalion, the ammunition wagon of the 2nd company carries 108
explosive cartridges, weighing 200 g. each, and that of the 3rd company
carries 48 fuzes.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>The ammunition carried in the cartridge boxes of the men may prove
insufficient during an action. On open ground the ammunition wagons,
assembled by regiment, accompany the regimental reserve, and in covered
terrain, they are assembled by battalion, and follow the battalion reserve.
When practicable, their position is to be indicated during the day by red
flags placed on their flank, and at night by green lanterns. In defense, an
adequate supply of ammunition should be deposited in rear of the firing line,
or should be at once distributed among the men. In attack, the ammunition
supply of the firing line and of the supports is to be replenished when they
enter ranges under 700 m. The best means of preventing shortage of ammunition
is to husband it at long ranges. Ammunition wagons are not to
be emptied and their contents distributed before an action begins; on the
contrary, the ammunition is to be issued during the fight, one wagon after
another being emptied. Ammunition may be sent forward from the reserve
to the firing line, the men who carry it remaining with that line. On the
other hand&mdash;and this seems to be the method most frequently employed&mdash;men
from the firing line may be sent to the rear for ammunition. The men
of the reserves at once turn over one-half of their cartridges to these men,
who are then assembled and sent forward under the command of a non-commissioned
officer. The ammunition is carried forward in sacks&mdash;so-called
“bashlicks.”</p>

<h5>FRANCE.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>Each company has one ammunition wagon, which is a part of the combat
train (<i>train de combat</i>), and carries 16,384 Lebel cartridges, and 36
intrenching tools. It can carry 19,000 rounds of the new “D” ammunition,<a id="FNanchor519" href="#Footnote519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>
So long as any ammunition remains in the ammunition wagons, they
remain under all circumstances with their battalion. They are assembled
in battalion groups on the left flank of their battalion. When the battalion<span class="pagenum" id="Page481">[481]</span>
is broken up for advance, flank, rear guard, or outpost work, they remain
with the main body of the battalion. When the companies are separated
for a protracted period, the battalion commander decides whether or not
the ammunition wagons should accompany their respective companies. The
ammunition in the wagons is, as a general rule, to be distributed before the
commencement of an action. If this is impossible when the force is taken
by surprise, the commander of the group of ammunition wagons must bring
them up as close as possible under cover, and the battalion commander must
supervise the distribution of the ammunition. In quarters and on the
march, the ammunition is to be replenished by taking the ammunition from
the sick, from the men detailed away, or from the supply carried by the
baggage wagon.<a id="FNanchor520" href="#Footnote520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The ammunition in the baggage wagon is only to be
used when all these other sources are exhausted. When an encounter with
the enemy may be expected, and only a short march is anticipated, the ammunition
carried in the baggage wagons may be distributed before starting.</p>

</div><!--longqote-->

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote519" href="#FNanchor519" class="label">[519]</a> The company ammunition wagon Model 1893 weighs 287 kg. when empty,
and 770 kg. when filled. It carries 14,400 rounds of ammunition (net capacity
48%) or 66 rounds per rifle.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote520" href="#FNanchor520" class="label">[520]</a> The baggage wagon weighs 450 kg. when empty, and 1054 kg. when
loaded. It carries 36 intrenching tools, and a tool chest. Its net capacity
is 45%. Forty knapsacks may be transported on this wagon in lieu of the
ammunition.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<div class="longquote">

<p>Any further replenishment of ammunition is to be ordered by the
division commander. The empty company ammunition wagons are assembled
in regimental groups and follow at least 1,000 m. in rear of the
regimental reserve. At each halt, the wagon train is to prepare for defense.
The regimental commander is to regulate the distribution of the
ammunition sent forward by the ammunition columns.</p>

<p>When this distribution cannot be made for some reason or other, the
wagons, assembled in groups of four, follow their battalions. It is the duty
of the battalion commander to keep the firing line supplied with ammunition.
The contents of the company ammunition wagons are not to be
replenished from the ammunition columns during an action. The ammunition
is to be removed from the dead and wounded.</p>

<p>The source of the ammunition supply is the corps ammunition park,
which is divided into three echelons, as follows:</p>

<p>1st echelon consists of two infantry ammunition columns and marches
at the head of the combat train of the troops engaged;</p>

<p>IInd echelon consists of three infantry ammunition columns;</p>

<p>IIIrd echelon carries artillery ammunition only.</p>

<p>Two infantry ammunition columns of the 1st echelon, which, as a rule,
constitutes the “ammunition supply center” at the commencement of an
action, march at the head of the combat train (<i>train de combat</i>). A half-filled
infantry ammunition column must at all times be available at this
“ammunition supply center.” Ammunition wagons of the infantry ammunition
column are sent forward at the request of the division commander
to the position taken up by the company ammunition wagons. The latter
are generally posted not more than 1,000 m. in the rear of the fighting line,
and parts of each infantry ammunition column (usually one ammunition<span class="pagenum" id="Page482">[482]</span>
wagon for each battalion) are posted by an officer not more than 1,500 m. in
rear of these. The empty company ammunition wagons are not refilled,
the ammunition being sent forward directly from the ammunition columns.
As soon as the infantry ammunition columns are informed which organizations
they are to supply, they send out non-commissioned officers to locate
the ammunition wagons of those organizations and establish communication
with them. The commander of the ammunition column directs where empty
ammunition wagons are to assemble. In emergencies, wagons of the infantry
ammunition column may also drive close up to the fighting line. In
this case, empty wagons assemble near the groups of company ammunition
wagons, and from there they are sent back in trains to the ammunition
column to which they belong.</p>

<p>Every opportunity, such as a lull in the fight, or an abatement of the
hostile fire, etc., must be utilized to distribute the ammunition of the company
wagons or of the ammunition column.</p>

<p>It is prohibited to send wagons or men to the rear for the purpose of
bringing up ammunition on the battlefield. All men sent forward with
ammunition should remain in the firing line.</p>

<h5>ENGLAND.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>The British infantryman is usually provided with 115, and each machine
gun with 3,500 rounds of ammunition. Each battalion is, in addition, provided
with 8 pack animals, each carrying two ammunition chests containing
4,400 cartridges (77 kg.), and with 8 ammunition wagons.</p>

<p>On the march, the pack animals and half of the ammunition wagons
follow immediately in rear of the battalion. The (16) remaining wagons
form a reserve ammunition column at the disposal of the brigade commander,
and march at the tail of the brigade. When an engagement is anticipated,
50 additional rounds (1.3 kg.) may be issued to each man before
leaving camp. During an action, one pack animal and two ammunition
wagons follow each half-battalion. Empty company ammunition wagons
are refilled from the brigade reserve ammunition column. When the
wagons of the latter are empty, they are replaced by filled wagons from
the ammunition column. The teams are not transferred with the wagons,
but remain with the organization to which they belong.</p>

<p>Ammunition wagons are expected to approach to within about 900 m.
of the firing line, and pack animals to within 450 m. One non-commissioned
officer and two or three privates are to be detailed from each company to
bring up ammunition. Each man is to carry a sack containing 600 cartridges
(16 kg.). That this method of supplying ammunition is practicable
under fire is shown by the distinguished conduct lists for <b>Paardeberg</b>,
where men were praised or decorated for endurance and fearlessness in
bringing up ammunition. (See p. 371 supra). The men who bring up
ammunition may be kept in the firing line when the ground is devoid of
cover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page483">[483]</span></p>

and artillery ammunition, constitute an integral part of the artillery battalions.</p>

<h5>ITALY.</h5>

<div class="longquote">

<p>When an encounter with the enemy is anticipated, the ammunition
wagons are to be emptied, the men detailed to carry ammunition are to
remove their packs, and each one of them is to carry ammunition weighing
about 7.5 kg.</p>

<p>The packs are to be removed only in case of urgent necessity. When
this is ordered, however, the soldier first removes all the cartridges and
the emergency ration from his pack. The ammunition knapsacks, which are
always to be taken along, are, however, carried in turn by all the soldiers
of the company.</p>

<p>The advancing units that are in need of ammunition, may demand it
from troops ordered to remain behind. They take along their own ammunition
carriers. The latter, assembled in a squad, distribute the ammunition
along the firing line, and remain with that line. In the first lull that occurs,
they assemble again as a squad and take part as such in the action.</p>

<p>The empty ammunition knapsacks belonging to organizations in reserve
are to be refilled as rapidly as possible from the ammunition wagons sent
forward from the ammunition park to the fighting line.</p>

<p>The ammunition of the dead and wounded is to be removed ind distributed
among the remaining men. During pauses in the fire, the ammunition
is to be equalized in all organizations engaged in the fire fight.</p>

<p>The ammunition wagons of the echelons in rear are to approach the
fighting line as far as the available cover permits. Their position is to be
indicated by flags. The ammunition carriers are to come to these wagons
to refill the empty ammunition knapsacks.</p>

</div>

<h4>3. WHAT DEDUCTIONS MAY BE MADE FROM THE
REGULATIONS OF THE VARIOUS ARMIES.</h4>

<p>1. The contents of the ammunition wagons should be
distributed at the commencement of an action. This should not
be done too early as the packing and unpacking of ammunition
takes time, and as the soldier will not march so well when
loaded down at the wrong time with 60 to 75 additional cartridges
(1.8 to 2.4 kg.), unequally distributed in haversack and
pockets. It is also a good plan to issue as many rounds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page484">[484]</span>
ammunition to the non-commissioned officers as to the men.
During a fight this ammunition can then be distributed to the
men.</p>

<p>2. As soon as the ammunition wagons have been refilled
from the ammunition columns, which have been brought up,
they should at once endeavor to rejoin their battalions and
should then follow as close as possible in rear of the latter.
The expenditure of ammunition will never be equally distributed
along the line; therefore, if the battalion commander
retains all four ammunition wagons directly under his own
orders, he will be better able to equalize the supply of ammunition
than would be the case if each ammunition wagon, as soon
as it is refilled, were to follow its own company, which, in
many cases, it will scarcely find again.</p>

<p>3. It is the duty of the commander to assign a few ammunition
wagons belonging to organizations held in reserve to
bodies of troops which will in all probability need a greater
quantity of ammunition.</p>

<p>4. The organization must be in possession of an adequate
supply of ammunition on entering the zone of effective fire,
i.e., at a distance of 600 m. from the enemy. The sending of
individual men to the rear for the purpose of bringing up
ammunition will only be practicable in rare cases. As a rule,
the violence of the hostile fire will make this impossible. Only
the best men can be sent back. It is asking too much to expect
them to cross twice the zone swept by hostile fire. Moreover,
the best men are needed in the firing line to encourage the
weaker element, and to replace disabled squad leaders. Under
no circumstances should the firing line be withdrawn to get
ammunition from the ammunition wagons, as an attack made
unexpectedly by the enemy might find the position unoccupied
and thus cause its loss.<a id="FNanchor521" href="#Footnote521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> It is a general principle that ammunition
must be sent forward from the rear.</p>

Examples: The loss of the park at Coulmiers (<span class="smcap">Helvig</span>, <i>Das 1. bayerische
Armeekorps</i>, p. 202). The engagement at Daix on January 21st, 1871 (<i>Geschichte
des Regiments Nr. 61</i>, p. 174). <span class="smcap">Kunz</span>, <i>Loigny-Poupry</i>, p. 77.</p>

<p>5. The ammunition can be removed from the dead and
wounded only in defense, or in attack when the forward movement
has come to a standstill. In an advance, it cannot be
done without retarding the movement and without affording
individual men an excuse to remain behind.</p>

<p>6. The bringing up of ammunition by individual men,
left to their own devises, is not to be recommended, as it facilitates
“shirking”; moreover, if one of the men is disabled, the
ammunition he carries will never reach the firing line. Ammunition
should either be sent to the firing line with each support,
or it should be carried by detachments sent forward in thin
skirmish lines under the command of non-commissioned officers.
These detachments should remain with the firing line.</p>

<p>7. Whether or not signals for informing the troops in
rear of a shortage of ammunition in the firing line will fulfill
the expectations entertained for them, can only be determined
by the test of war.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</h2>

<p>Depending on the hard- and software used to read this text, not all elements may display as intended.</p>

<p>The language used in this text is that of the printed book, including the use of inconsistent, erroneous,
unusual or archaic spelling, hyphenation, capitalisation, punctuation, etc., except as indicated under Changes
below. This applies to proper and geographical names and non-English words and phrases as well; accents and diacriticals
have not been added or corrected unless mentioned below.</p>

<p>The use of physical units has not been corrected; for example, the author regularly uses m for speed, kgm for energy, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to the abbreviations given on page xxi, the book regularly uses differently abbreviated or shortened
titles (sometimes single words) or translations of references; this has not been standardised.</p>

<p>Page ix, Table of Contents: the differences between the Table of Contents and the headings in the text have not been
rectified. Apart from (minor) differences in wording, not all headings in the text occur in the
Table of Contents, and not all entries in the Table of Contents occur as headings in the text.
Any auto-generated Table of Contents may therefore differ from the one on page ix ff.</p>

<p>Page 71, “in double column of twice the width of front”: the source document was unclear at this point, the text might
also have read “in double column or twice the width of front”.</p>

<p>Page 183, 187: (Général) Le Joindre is the author of the publication, but his name is presented here as part of the title.</p>

<p>Page 195, troop diagram: depending on
the available display width, this may or may not be visible as a single front in this e-text (the diagram was displayed
over two rows in the printed book as well).</p>

<p>Page 475: The table appears to contain totals that do not agree with the data provided. Since it is not clear where the error
was made, these calculations have been left as they were: row Germany, last column; row Austria, last column but one;
row France, last column.</p>

<p id="Footnote513">The table contains footnote markers, but there are no corresponding footnotes on this or the following pages. In an earlier
edition of the book, the footnotes (using the numbering from the table in this text) were as follows:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a href="#FNanchor513" class="label">[513]</a> The strength of a company is assumed as 200 men (England excepted).</p>

<p><a href="#FNanchor513" class="label">[514]</a> 10 Cartridges packed in a box.</p>

<p><a href="#FNanchor513" class="label">[515]</a> New &#8220;D&#8221; ammunition.</p>

<p><a href="#FNanchor513" class="label">[516]</a> During the Russo-Japanese war.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p class="blankbefore15"><b>Changes made</b></p>

<p>Some minor obvious typographical and punctuation errors have been corrected silently; some
tables have been re-arranged for better readability.</p>

<p>Footnotes and illustrations have been moved outside text paragraphs.</p>

<p>Spaced and non-spaced and italicised or regular “i.e.” and “Ibid./ibid.” have been standardised to “<i>i.e.</i>” and
“<i>Ibid.</i>”/“<i>ibid.</i>” “Minarelli Fitzgerald”
has been standardised to “Minarelli-Fitzgerald”.</p>

<p>Elements in <span class="illotext">dotted lines</span> are not present as such in the text, but have been
transcribed from the accompanying illustration for the sake of clarity.</p>

<p>Page 8: “sans le comprendre” and “sans le faire” changed to “sans la comprendre” and “sans la faire”.</p>

<p>Various pages: “Wald und Ortsgefecht” and “Gruppen und Einheitsangriff” have been changed to
“Wald- und Ortsgefecht” and “Gruppen- und Einheitsangriff”.</p>

<p>Page 11,  footnote [18]: opening quote marks inserted before When one attempts ....</p>

<p>Page 93: closing quote marks inserted after ... (300-400 paces).</p>

<p>Page 143, footnote [139]: closing quote mark deleted at end of footnote.</p>

<p>Page 180: B′, C′ and D′ in the text have been changed to B, C and D cf.
the illustration. Footnote [170]: angles have been transcribed α, β and γ for consistency with the illustration and the text.</p>

<p>Page 195: Negrier changed to Négrier; footnote anchor [191] inserted.</p>

<p>Page 229: closing quote mark inserted after ... the size of this echelon.</p>

<p>Page 257: “and that cover to be utilized only” changed to “and that cover be utilized only”.</p>

<p>Page 265, table: the column header “Machine gun” has
been considered to be a heading a single column only.</p>

<p>Page 304, footnote [306]: closing quote mark inserted after ... of units in rear.</p>

<p>Page 324: “Csicseries v. Bacsany” changed to “Csicserics v. Bacsany”; “Feldgeschüts” changed to “Feldgeschütz”.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
